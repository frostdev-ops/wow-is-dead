If you like this content, play it in the modpack to gain the best experience!**\n---\nThis mod is sort of a remastered verison of data pack [Horse Whistle](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/horse-whistle-call-your-horse-to-come-to-you-just-like-that-in-red-dead-redemption-2/).\nWe made it so when you press H to whistle, your saddled friend will neigh, hightline itself of seconds, find its way to come along(or teleport closer first if necessary), and follow you for a while.\n\nTo do this,you must meet the following conditions:\n1. The horse/donky/mule must be **Tamed by yourself**.\n2. It should be within 128 blocks, otherwise it cannot hear your whistle.(This can be configured for versions after 1.0.1）\n3. It cannot be leashed or being ridden.\n4. Added new item:Ender horse armor.\nIf your horse is equipped with ender horse armor，you can:\n1.Call your horse anytime, anywhere\n2.If your horse dies, you can still bring it back to life\n\n**One more thing!**\nWe added a new feature: **Spur**! When you are riding, press H to spur your horse on. It will get a little injured, but it will speed up for a while! Even more, there are two levels of spur-speed, meaning that you can spur it twice to make it run even faster.\n\n**Credit**\n- Thank [Kltyton](https://modrinth.com/user/kltyton) for solving the UUID problem, adding the new teleport mechanic, and optimizing the codes!! \n\n## 版权声明|License\n- **作者保留该作品的所有权利。禁止在其他社交平台（包括群聊、网盘等）重新上传或商用，否则后果自负。** This content is All Rights Reserved, meaning that you cannot redistribute/modify & distribute this content, or use it in commercial ways. \n\n- **欢迎您将其收录到整合包中或用其制作视频，请在简介处附上此发布页面的链接和[我的bilibili主页](https://space.bilibili.com/190900020)，也欢迎在简介艾特我，我很想看你们的视频！**\nIf you make a video about this content or put this content in your modpack, please give credit and link to this page, and I would love to know!

The mod adds over 190 different types of ruin variants to the game, each with their own unique custom loot tables. This includes some hidden bosses that you can discover while exploring the lost remnants of ruins. The mod aims to add ancient ruins similar to what you see in real life by introducing lore to Minecraft, thereby enhancing gameplay functionality.\nTwo interesting features of this mod are:\n- Most loot will likely be buried underground or covered with stones from the ruins.\n- Unlike other structure mods, Philip’s Ruins makes most of its structures look like actual ruins. \n\nThis is achieved by blending the ruin with the terrain instead of having a rigid drop-off at the end of a structure, which is common in most mods during rough terrain generation.\nThis approach makes the ruins you come across look like they were there before any other structures, like villages, came to pass. It gives a vintage, ancient look to the current ruins, maintaining the structure along with terrain erosion.\n\n![Description](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/e939286ebf8f06b96f6f10bcabf8b4e7a9a01f7a.png)\n![Description](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/d2a7f3cbdaf118b4579386c6df755f56d0d3676e.png)\n\nIf you would like to support the mod’s development, join our Discord server.

FPS","description":"Reduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.","body":"# Dynamic FPS\n\nReduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.\n\n## Features\n\nDynamic FPS will detect whether the Minecraft window is currently active, being hovered over, unfocused, or invisible.  \nFor each of these states you're able to adjust the frame rate, volume, and whether [toast notifications](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Toasts) are temporarily paused.\n\nThere's also an option to enter an idle state while the window is active but hasn't received any input in a certain amount of time.\n\n---\n\nIn addition to this Dynamic FPS fixes a vanilla bug causing higher-than-necessary background CPU usage and stops \nrendering the world while it's being obscured by opaque screens or the resource loading overlay, helping especially on low-end systems.\n\n## Installation\n\nDynamic FPS is available for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/juliand665/Dynamic-FPS/releases), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamic-fps), and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-fps).  \nTo access the in-game config screen you'll also need to install [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config).\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n- Why is Minecraft still running at 15 FPS?\n\nDynamic FPS will only slow the client render loop to a minimum of 15 cycles per second.\nLower frame rates are achieved by then cancelling the rendering of all superfluous frames, e.g. 14 out of 15 frames are cancelled for 1 FPS.\n\nThis lets you resume playing almost instantly after switching back to the game:\nInstead of having to wait for up to a second until the next rendered frame comes along, the game checks back within 1/15th of a second.\n","published":"2020-12-01T15:57:46.862046Z","updated":"2024-05-29T16:56:29.745738Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":3747264,"followers":3551,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.2-pre1","1.16.2-pre2","1.16.2-pre3","1.16.2-rc1","1.16.2-rc2","1.16.2","1.16.3-rc1","1.16.3","1.16.4-pre1","1.16.4-pre2","1.16.4-rc1","1.16.4","20w45a","20w46a","20w48a","20w49a","20w51a","1.16.5-rc1","1.16.5","21w03a","1.17","1.17.1-pre1","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","24w09a","24w10a","24w11a","24w12a","24w13a","24w14potato","24w14a","1.20.5-pre1","1.20.5-pre2","1.20.5-pre3","1.20.5-pre4","1.20.5-rc1","1.20.5-rc2","1.20.5-rc3","1.20.5","1.20.6","24w18a","24w19a","24w19b","24w20a","24w21a","24w21b","1.21-pre1","1.21-pre2","1.21-pre3"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["kurPEwi6","gVvtLF6M","XlBOTUIQ","muZxaaxq","oIZUkvvs","RgJGw0dO","Co2w6nIh","LttnLLIj","g9FOSLTq","tChVqk53","Usg995P0","Dfw5rXkQ","8feSMAfR","BRhzFUHi","NzEhyQyc","hWM6qcqA","sejsYSOg","53FTYNg4","8ZK3Yrx8","5LX1Blqr","gi2eS21F","NeKJoURy","3WUIXnPq","MT0Hhrmt","xJziTz7j","KBaicJn7","MJxmQ042","HyfaQLUy","ufaW1r8S","1npK5wCt","apxb2RCR","k6MHtC5D","QLkpv8Ld","5NDr40VW","qU25ZOM2","e2GoOHqC","LLW6Rz4X","tBXQeb6B","PdOcOZe5","IC26VVbo","aIfiOstF","6XTTKHFs","wOSxC0Zb","lffwyl3t","EqKUlwIM","E8I4fCdF","TiEIglop","6ZZnpiKt","RaQsEbig","IntaQuNq","8zD1HoDT","cBDPkvTM","kmNGyLFl","lHhemLYM","JzqaccpR","DIVSdFSY","ON9j8VE4","OeMT2cC8","ksK11lcD","Ec4NqAob","XzHVv85p","nLicebq0","OZ1kEY2A","2A0fjGIj","UL1yMXMO","RdFrLKPC","v2hnzsRt","9ItmBJnL","eghSjWeK","mwACShkf","tpCuDULl","IORbL2mx","EhV5xUXs","tGTBddY1","yhhpGEhV","QBGkeC7m","4YGsF2sR","XGwn4gNc","THG0PVdn","9HB3KfC8","PnFGjxcb","3eTIv2kA","CD4gyQlk","qU5QelCK","akci2PEc","hdO7gDw8","xRLXdhYl","xCKeVizz","O7a5N5VT","SsL3jQXt","r8rpH64x","eGHFlVzX","pR3KcCvX","E4fdZphD","RRLjJEKm","tQFy1FeZ","vGmLfA3R","khb32G0k","ZvR7ufZu","lfIMkupj","Jwsj9hnw","n9joHa1e","lW5W9ena","kWB5Orlp","YoeLPRqx","6HsZEX1E","shfvdKKK","NhH3bdcX","Obc6GFkK","AEjABoYz","c9Pa2Sap","qPlkTrvl","5VqjJ4M6","SMbXVy9A","3DtySnI3","KB42DIPY","4GgVhh2s","nGi7w36N","8qMOAA4B","pQo2WjRY","2mbM4NFn","33B4KCsj","NSmsdNiu","g3gquqif","FWwfvgYH","dgeCtXsu","fY95HR8z","48hFxWw7","M9XF5FlW","AK9FBEgo","BJSHfipe","y3LKh1gi","tqCNpIoc","tBrRMDS7","5U2bHbH6","rD3FWXH7","OpDYYPhR","jeq5Pk2P"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LQ3K71Q1/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"48hFxWw7","project_id":"LQ3K71Q1","author_id":"HXiopoLj","featured":false,"name":"v3.4.3","version_number":"3.4.3","changelog":"Changes:\n\n-

\n\nSounds is a Minecraft mod that adds a variety of new sound effects and improves existing ones that don't quite fit. It's a game-changer for all players, making the vanilla experience feel incomplete by comparison!\n\nIt's also a spiritual continuation of both ExtraSounds and Auditory. It reimplements some popular features from Auditory and includes all the sound effects from ExtraSounds, providing a rich and immersive soundscape for your game.\n\n# Features\n\n- **Over 35 Configurable Sound Effects:** Customize sound effects for various game events, including UI interactions, chat messages, and in-game actions.\n\n- **Dynamic Block and Item Sounds:** Enjoy unique sounds for all block items, with over 25 different sound categories handcrafted for more than 100 items, ensuring a well-crafted auditory experience.\n\n- **Resource Pack Compatibility:** Easily add dynamic sounds using resource packs, allowing for seamless compatibility with other mods.\n\n- **Data Generation APIs:** Utilize Sounds' data generation providers to add dynamic sounds within your own mods, enhancing customizability and flexibility.\n\n- **Sound Additions and Tweaks:** Sounds adds missing sound effects and tweaks existing ones that do not fit well in-game, creating a more cohesive audio environment.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"520px\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EkwF-D2qR30\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n# Configuration\n\nSounds offers a robust configuration system powered by YACL, providing an easy-to-use and navigable interface.\n\nAdjust settings to customize the mod's sound effects to your preferences.

Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Fabric on versions of Minecraft before 1.19?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Older downloads are found on the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/visual-workbench-fabric\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>old project page</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Does this work with crafting tables from other mods?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Yes, it does, but support has to be manually enabled per block. Many modded crafting tables are supported by default, those that are not can be added to a custom config file found at <code>.minecraft/config/visual_workbench.json</code> (not accessible from in-game). If you add a crafting table yourself and it doesn't work it is likely incompatible with this mod.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Now that items stay in the table, clearing the interface is so tedious.

Extras\n\nAn addon for Fabric Seasons that adds custom blocks and items to make your experience better.\n\n</center>\n\n### Description\n\nFabric Seasons doesn't add any items or blocks by itself, so if you want a complete experience you'll need this mod.\n\nIf you want **detailed** in-game **help** about the mod and its **additions** I strongly recommend installing the [Patchouli](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/patchouli-fabric) mod.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/KYJrtUI.png\">\n</center>\n\n### Greenhouses\n\nTo **deal** with the seasonal **impact** on crop growth Fabric Seasons: Extras adds 4 blocks that can be used to build fully functional **greenhouses**, with their own **microclimates**, that allow you to **optimize** crop growth **speed** in any season.\n\nThe blocks are:\n- Greenhouse Glass - **Passive block** that creates a **warmer** microclimate\n- Tinted Greenhouse Glass - **Passive block** that creates a **colder** microclimate\n- Crop Heater - **Active machine** that can create a **warmer** microclimate with up to **3 levels**\n- Crop Chiller - **Active machine** that can create a **colder** microclimate with up to **3 levels**\n\nTo **assist** you while building your greenhouses, you can craft the **Crop Season Tester**. An item that **scans** the right-clicked **block** and shows what season is currently affecting it.\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\nApart from the greenhouse resources, Fabric Seasons: Extras adds **other blocks** such as:\n- Season Detector - **Redstone component** that outputs a redstone **signal** based on the **current season** and the block's configuration.\n- Season Calendar - Helpful **item/black** that can show you the season **progress** and how many **days** are left until the next season.\n\n### Other Information\n\nFor bug reporting please proceed to the mod's GitHub repository: [https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons-extras](https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons-extras)\n\nIf you have any other questions or suggestions, feel free to call me on Discord @D4rk#0693  \nYou can find me in the Cafeteria Development guild.\n\n[![](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/707435077679841350/embed.png?style=banner2&v=2)](https://discord.com/invite/G4PjhEf)","published":"2023-03-20T08:00:37.047111Z","updated":"2023-06-09T21:57:30.712411Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":471063,"followers":192,"categories":["technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["ZsIzAEfK","XR4aiIK6","Hz4mjAwN","3zXY1Mv9","mHzvDy67","QtDFoiGb","K6nEBM2o","NSa0G7u9","ncdVTDpt","j9GoL3Wu","H6OLpHJp"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/64FYdx5z/472d8a2341cb8f65588420019a7667008cc90e33.png"},"version":{"id":"H6OLpHJp","project_id":"64FYdx5z","author_id":"TPRVvJKm","featured":false,"name":"Fabric Seasons Extras 1.2-BETA","version_number":"1.2-BETA+1.20","changelog":"A changelog can be found at https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons-extras/commits/","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-09T21:57:31.465761Z","downloads":374100,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"ebe526d2f0b64029611de50ac47d709d0eff23b1ebb4d5dfae60738dec5f39126b4982f61d0c0607e2cdaf353d01eb2fe4faf1b23babc7477c6be1df60b3916a","sha1":"fcbb318906832b9d919dd64b023118889290fbd9"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/64FYdx5z/versions/H6OLpHJp/fabric-seasons-extras-1.2-BETA%2B1.20.jar","filename":"fabric-seasons-extras-1.2-BETA+1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":273134,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"dJtxMqxE","project_id":"KJe6y9Eu","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"ASWTUSvb","user":{"id":"TPRVvJKm","username":"D4rkness_King","name":"Luca Argolo","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/TPRVvJKm/icon.png","bio":"","created":"2020-12-01T01:52:35.107689Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"fabric-seasons-extras-1.2-BETA+1.20.jar"},"mods\\mcw-bridges-3.0.0-mc1.20.1fabric.jar":{"sha512":"7f7ef65fd569d2ea6cf3fa49a9b6a1b8f9f5736b143c8a158f765a17424b18a60c254c6c68c23279ff625c740b0028bec7ce26b6804c3e13159251112b24ced7","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"GURcjz8O","slug":"macaws-bridges","project_type":"mod","team":"w0R55u0J","title":"Macaw's Bridges","description":"A simple mod that adds a lot of bridges!","body":"![Banner image](https://i.imgur.com/0c6CcpY.png)\n\n[![YouTube](https://img.shields.io/youtube/channel/subscribers/UCc_kqzt253fnG2RHW_CZL2A?label=Youtube&style=for-the-badge)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc_kqzt253fnG2RHW_CZL2A)[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-%20-ffffff)![Twitter](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/sketch_macaw?color=6eb7ec&label=Twitter&logo=twitter&style=for-the-badge)![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-%20-ffffff)](https://twitter.com/sketch_macaw)[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/645360921673465857?color=a97db2&logo=discord&logoColor=f&style=for-the-badge)](https://discord.gg/RFQqDEb)[![Crafting Recipes](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Crafting%20Recipes-bc8f56?style=for-the-badge)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dBcTfrt-MH91NuCmJzqbFDjrLftuKMc08fp4bjGJCD4/edit#gid=712741639)\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GUtHhCc.png)\n\n![About](https://i.imgur.com/A1pclRa.png)\n\nThis simple mod adds a variety of bridges.

To resolve this issue, you'll need to perform a block update on affected bridges or stairs. Here's how:\n\nPlace any block above/next to the affected bridge or stairs, or break and replace the affected bridge or stairs, which will trigger an update for neighboring bridges.\n\nWe highly recommend creating backups of your existing game worlds before applying this update.\n\nChangelog:\n\nPerformance:\n- Made many changes, to reduce the memory usage as much as I could, lowered memory usage by 80-90%.\n- Refactored code to be more efficient and optimized\n- Lowered the count of all blockstates by 85 - 89 % \n  ( From 13920 to 1516 )\n- Removed lots of model.jsons and made them more efficient\n\nAdded :\n- Stone Bridges, Stairs, Piers have new variations \n  ( nether bricks, mossy cobblestone, cobblestone, end stone bricks,\n   prismarine bricks, andesite, granite, diorite )\n- New Balustrade Stone Bridges ( 17 variations )\n- Red Asian Bridge, Support, Stairs\n- Glass Bridge, Support, Stairs\n\nBridge Torch & Lantern:\n- Can be placed on bridge/bridge stairs railings ( They have a tooltip )\n- Cannot be placed in the middle\n- They break if there is no solid block below them\n\nBridge Piers:\n- Can now be waterlogged (again!..)\n- Have a new model\n\nChanges:\n- Most bridges have an improved model\n- All Bridges have now the same height (base/railings), this change fixes the no step sounds whilst walking on a bridge\n- Removed Torches in bridges, made separate torches which can be placed on bridge/bridge stair railing ( to prevent doubling the states because of this..)\n- Rope Bridges have only 2 facing sides, north and east. Since west and south would be the same as north and east, we decided to merge it so it wont create redundant blockstates\n- Bridge handrails/handguards have been reworked, you can now toggle between all 4 sides or empty platform, with this change you can modify bridges like never before\n- Bridges have an updated placing mechanism, if you place a bridge while on a bridge, it will place down a bridge in the way you are facing ( Similar to the scaffolding )\n- Bridge Stairs have also an updated placing mechanism, if you place the stair on the stair, it will build another stair one block behind and above it, this way you can easily build bridge stairs upwards.\n- Shears can be used like pliers\n- Bridges now have a tooltip about Pliers/Shears\n- Bridges and Stairs cannot be placed directly above themselves, this makes it easier to build\n- Bridge Piers/Supports no longer connect but they have an improved model to make them look just as good as before\n- All Stone recipes can now be crafted in the stonecutter too\n- Bridges now have the tag Trapdoors, this is because entities are pathfinding it when it has the tag...\n\nNew Translations:\nfr_fr by Calvineries\nko_kr by spinodal23\nuk_ua by Moonvvell\nes_cl by Ganbare-Lucifer\n\nUpdated Translations:\nru_ru by mindryder\nde_de by PatrickK01\nes_es by Divinium115\n\nIssues Fixed:\n- Bridges have no step sound\n- Wrong breaking sounds on a few blocks\n- Wrong hardness on some blocks\n- Bridge Piers/Supports cannot be waterlogged\n- Two Wide Bridges don't connect to stairs\n- Stone and Log Bridges have wrong texture for bottom\n- Wrong texture UV size on some stairs\n- Iron Bridge can be used as fuel\n- Bridge stairs alignment is weird\n- Z-fighting on some bridges and stairs\n- Pliers do not appear in creative menu or JEI\n- Pliers unable to make a bridge fully open\n- Bamboo and Dry Bamboo Bridges and Stairs do not fully\n  connect\n- Missing mcw tags from some blocks\n- Mobs Pathfinding get stuck on bridge ( They now walk correctly on the base bridge, but when there is a block with handrail they will jump-move, but they are now pathfinding bridges )\n- Bridge Support is not a full block\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-06T14:33:42.367051Z","downloads":25621,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"21ea9c2124b315e2e69778e6c83491145647dee1","sha512":"7f7ef65fd569d2ea6cf3fa49a9b6a1b8f9f5736b143c8a158f765a17424b18a60c254c6c68c23279ff625c740b0028bec7ce26b6804c3e13159251112b24ced7"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/GURcjz8O/versions/RmsMXs3r/mcw-bridges-3.0.0-mc1.20.1fabric.jar","filename":"mcw-bridges-3.0.0-mc1.20.1fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":768682,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"w0R55u0J","user":{"id":"HTw9s4lh","username":"sketchmacaw","name":"Sketch Macaw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60577275?v=4","bio":"Welcome to my profile!

The **current season** is defined by the **world time** (using `/time set 0` will reset to day 1 of spring). Each season has its own changes; during the spring, biomes will mostly try to match their original characteristics.\n\nThe mod has 2 components:\n- **Server:** If installed on the server biomes will have different temperatures. (this enables weather changes like snowing and block freezing in the winter). The server component also contains seasonal crops, allowing crops to grow at different speeds according to the season.\n- **Client:** If installed on the client biomes will have different colormaps according to the current season. This is just a visual change and it'll not physically impact your world in any form.\n\nTo get the full experience it's recommended that you install the mod on both the server and the client.\n\n### Seasonal Biomes\n\nBiomes have **different temperatures** depending on the current **season**:\n\n- Cold Biomes will have rain in the summer\n- Temperate Biomes will have snow in the winter\n- Tropical Biomes will have a steady season all year round\n- Hot Biomes will have a rainy season in the winter\n\nDepending on the **original** temperature/precipitation of the **biome**, this behavior can change. \n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/NdYBkgC.gif\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gH5seb5.gif\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Qs600XR.gif\">\n</center>\n\n### Seasonal Crops\n\nCrops will grow at **different speeds** depending on the current **season**.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/75gqPqS.png\">\n</center>\n\nEach **individual crop** will have a **pre-configured** growth **speed** for one of the four seasons, this is controlled by a **datapack** and can be changed by the user if they want.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/dR4OYPT.png\">\n</center>\n\n### Other Information\n\nFor bug reporting please proceed to the mod's GitHub repository:

**Description**\nIn Minecraft there's Soul Fire, yet if you or a mob catch fire because of it nothing will change from normal fire.  \nThis mod makes Soul Fire actually work as one would expect, all whilst providing an *easy-to-use* API for modders that want to add their own custom fire and have it behave consistently.\n\n## **Features**\n- **Soul Fire overlay**  \n![Overlay](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/soul-fire-d/overlay.gif)\n- **Entities catching fire from Soul Fire will burn with actual Soul Fire.**  \nBurning from Soul Fire will deal 2 damage per second.  \n![Sheep](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/soul-fire-d/sheep.gif)\n- **Actually consistent Soul Fire behavior.**  \nFor instance, but not limited to, zombies burning from Soul Fire and arrows passing through Soul Fire can set their targets on Soul Fire.  \n![Arrows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/soul-fire-d/arrow.gif)\n- **Two new enchantments: Soul Fire Aspect and Soul Flame.**  \nAs their name suggests, they work exactly the same as Fire Aspect and Flame with the only difference being the kind of fire the target will burn from, with the consequent damage increase.  \nBoth these enchantments can be highly configured individually, enabling (default) or disabling them and more.  \n- **API for custom fire types:**  \nFor mod/datapack creators who want to add their own custom fire(s), or implement another mod's fire, this mod provides an *easy-to-use* API to register your fire(s) and have it(them) behave consistently **automatically**.  \nFurthermore for each new fire registered using this API there can be new custom Fire Aspect and Flame enchantments available in game **automatically**.  \nSee the bottom section *For developers* to know more.\n\n## **Dependencies**\n| Mod | Loader | Requirement |\n| :-: | :----: | :---------: |\n| [Forge Config API Port](https://modrinth.com/mod/forge-config-api-port) | Fabric | Required |\n\n## **License and right of use**\nFeel free to use this mod for any

Statistics Screen","description":"A Minecraft mod that improves the statistics screen and makes it more useful.","body":"## Better Statistics Screen\n\nThis Minecraft mod replaces the Vanilla statistics screen with an new and improved statistics screen that is easier to use and that has more helpful features. The new statistics screen features an easier to navigate and read UI layout, as well as a few filters and a search field that will help you find the statictics you need a lot easier, especially when there are dozens, if not hundreds of entries to keep track of.\n\n### Dependencies (v3.9.7+)\nNote that \"client\" refers to installing mods to the game launched through a Minecraft launcher, whereas \"server\" refers to installing mods to a server you join through the \"multiplayer\" menu.\n\n| Requirements | Client | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [Better Statistics Screen](#) | Optional | Optional |\n| [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/P7dR8mSH) | Required as of `1.20.5` | Required as of `1.20.5` |\n| [TCDCommons API](https://modrinth.com/mod/Eldc1g37) | Optional | Optional |\n| [Roughly Enough Items (REI)](https://modrinth.com/mod/nfn13YXA) | Optional | Not needed |\n| [Mod menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/mOgUt4GM) | Optional | Not needed |\n\n## Features\nThis mod aims to improve on the existing features, as well as add additional features that may futher be helpful in tracking and managing one's statistics.  \n  \nNote that any optional features that this mod adds to the game, such as the \"/statistics\" command and the \"Stat announcement system\", may be disabled in the config or though the in-game mod settings menu.\n\n### The `/statistics` command\n**Alt command:** `/stats`  \nThis is an optional feature that adds a command that allows people (with sufficient permission levels, such as OP) to manage and view player statistics through commands. This feature may also be useful for writing datapacks that may wanna read as well as manage player statistics.  \n\n*Note: Can be disabled in the config.*\n\n**The command syntax is the following:**\n- `/statistics clear <targets>`\n- `/statistics edit <targets> <stat_type> <stat> (set|increase) <value>`\n- [ex. general stat]: `/statistics edit @s minecraft:custom minecraft:jump set 123`\n- [ex. item stat]: `/statistics edit @s minecraft:used minecraft:wooden_shovel set 123`\n- [ex. mob stat]: `/statistics edit @s minecraft:killed minecraft:zombie set 123`\n\n### The \"Stat announcement system\"\nThis is an optional server-sided feature that broadcasts special messages when players do certain things or achieve certain stats or \"milestones\". As of `v3.9.7`, the SAS announces when players achieve certain stats for the first time, such as for example \"Mining their first diamond\", or \"Crafting their first item of a specific type\", and so on..  \n  \n*Note: Can be disabled in the config.*  \n  \n![The SAS in action](https://github.com/TheCSMods/mc-better-stats/assets/66475965/3467ecae-5393-4fa9-9bf3-5146cc07f7b7)\n\n### The \"General\" statistics tab\nThis tab does not add nor show anything special regarding general statistics other than the redesigned UI layout. The filters menu features a way for you to hide all general statistics that are currently set to '0', as well as a search bar that will help you look for a specific statistic.  \n  \n![General statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/f612dcb73d9e4ffc4ca0494559a31221396c2435.png)\n\n### The \"Items\" statistics tab\nThe items tab displays items in a visual grid of items, similar to how an inventory screen does it. The items are categorized in item groups, just like they would be in the creative inventory menu. All items you interacted with are shown in this tab. This will hopefully help you find the items you are looking for easier. The search field in the filters menu can be used to look for specific items. To see a statistic for an item, place your cursor over the said item, or use \"Tab\" to navigate to it using your keyboard, and a tooltip text will display the statistics. The \"Show item names\" checkbox defines whether or not the tooltip will also show the item name.  \n  \n![Item statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/5ef05e79400d4e0d386f899dc1849f72731c0372.png)\n\n### The \"Mobs\" statistics tab\nSimilar to the \"Items\" tab, the \"Mobs\" tab will also show mobs in a grid. The mobs are visually rendered on the GUI screen, so it is easier for you to find the mob you are looking for, and because it looks nicer. Just like with the items tab, to see the statistics for a given mob, place your cursor over the said mob, or use \"Tab\" to navigate to it using your keyboard. A tooltip text will show you the statistics.  \n  \n*Note that due to technical limitations in my programming, some mobs may fail to render properly, and some mobs may even appear as \"plain text\" instead of their 3D model due to errors in my rendering method.*  \n  \n![Mob statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/fd6c360face8ba7fcf05224a08044614c7eb9496.png)\n\n### The \"Food & drinks\" statistics tab (formerly \"A balanced diet\")\nThis tab aims to help you achieve the \"A balanced died\" advancement. It does that by displaying all food items in grouped grids, similarly to how the \"Items\" tab does it. This tab will show you all food items, even the ones you haven't interacted with, and will also highlight the foods you already ate before, helping you identify which foods you need to eat next to earn the advancement.  \n  \n*Note that this tab may not precisely tell you exactly which foods you do and do not need, as that kind of criteria is controlled \"server-side\", and may be modified by other mods and data-packs. As such, all foods are shown instead.*  \n\n![Food & drinks statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/9e3478d0573276349e9842337de3cf598dcf75db.png)\n\n### The \"Hostile creatures\" statistics tab (formerly \"Monsters Hunted\")\nThis tab aims to help you achieve the \"Monsters hunted\" advancement. It shows you a grid of mobs similarly to the \"Mobs\" tab, except the mobs shown on this tab are hostile creatures you have either killed or are yet to kill. Similarly to the \"Food & drinks\" tab, any mobs you have killed will be highlighted in this tab, helping you easily see which mobs you need to kill next in order to earn the advancement.  \n  \n*Note that just like with \"Food & drinks\", the criteria for getting the advancement is controlled server-side, and may be modified by other mods and data-packs. As such, all hostile creatures are always shown.*  \n\n![Hostile creatures statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/fe98cfce86319282774228f4f4c81748eaa00139.png)\n\n### In-game config menu\nA menu that lets you configure the mod in-game. Nothing more or less.  \n\n![In-game config menu](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/7413856bcf4e799b7e265bcf732f17cbb1e2e7c2.png)\n\n### MCBS files\nThis is an additional feature that aims to let people save a \"snapshot\" of their current statistics, into a file, which can then be opened later or shared with other players.  \n  \n*Note that opening an MCBS file does not \"override\" you current stats, as it only shows you what your stats looked like at the time you saved the MCBS file.*\n\n![Saving a file](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/315ca6da7dcb943b3435c6a11917393786ae4367.png)\n![Opening a file](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/5f1855efceb8870339456bb1d3e8235d795f3cfe.png)\n\n### The statistics hud\nThis is another additional feature that allows you to \"pin\" any stat to the \"in-game-hud\", where you can then look at any statistic of your choosing as you play the game. To pin a stat, simply right-click it with your mouse (hold down shift as well if you have REI installed).  \n\n*Note that due to technical limitations, pinned statistics update occasionally by default, and will not update \"live\" unless this mod is installed on the server-side as well and the \"live stat updates\" is enabled on the client-side.*  \n\n![Pinning stats](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/3c7e15962f4c8a2268bc5da9a2e7d97ae7850fb6.png)\n![Configuring pinned stats](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/681f25b72304d0fdde71ab3104d51fab506c3c34.png)\n![What pinned stats look like during gameplay](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/fd7f29e99ed6b73981b2e2cbcdb4eddb93a2bbcb.png)\n\n## Some QnA\n- What about Minecraft Forge?\n    - I have no plans on making future ports to Forge or any other mod loaders. See [GitHub Issue #100](https://github.com/TheCSMods/mc-better-stats/issues/100) for more info. However, not all hope is lost! [Sinytra Connector](https://modrinth.com/mod/u58R1TMW) is a mod that lets people run Fabric mods on Forge! Please check it out. Also keep in mind the mod is in beta (as of me writing this), so please don't be harsh towards the mod's developers while expecting the mod to work 100% of the time.\n- Port to older Minecraft versions?\n    - Nope. Same reason as the 'Minecraft Forge' one.\n- I can't pin stats to the hud. I right-click them, but REI shows up instead. How do I pin stats?\n    - Hold down the left shift button while right clicking a stat. That is, if you have REI installed.\n\n## Credits\nThank you to everyone who contributed to the project and helped translate the mod to other languages! And a special thank **you**, the person reading this, for choosing to use this mod! (Well, thank you even if you're just checking out the mod and not actually using it. That also means a lot!)\n\n### The showcase YouTube video I recorded\nI decided to test the mod as well as take screenshots and video footage of the mod in my survival world from the [Better Minecraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/better-mc-fabric) mod pack, so as to show how this mod works and that it works with modded features as well. The screenshots and the video footage also feature the [Complementary Shaders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders) being used alongside [Iris](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/irisshaders), as well as the [BYG](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oh-the-biomes-youll-go) mod.\n\n### The screenshots I took\nResource packs and shader packs used at the time of screenshotting.\n- [Complementary shaders](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/)\n- [3D Default](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/5aPp18Lx)\n- [3D crops Revamped](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/PgpTtNoI)\n- [Default Dark Mode](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/6SLU7tS5)\n\nSorry if I missed any.

What about Resource Packs?\n  - Falling Leaves _should_ be 100% compatible with any modded trees and any resource pack changing leaves!\n\n- Does this need to be installed on the server for multiplayer?\n  - Nope! This mod is 100% client-side.\n\n- Lol fabric suxxx gief forge plx.\n  - Cheaterpaul [ported this mod to Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/falling-leaves-forge \"Forge port\"), note that this port is inofficial and might not always be up-to-date, it also does configuration differently.\n\n- Do you have any screenshots I could look at before I install this?\n  - Sure! Check out the [images section](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/falling-leaves-fabric/screenshots) of this mod's Curseforge page.  \n    (Note that they are slightly out of date.)\n\n- I enjoy old things. Can you backport this to Minecraft 1.7?\n  - No. We will only focus on supporting the most recently released version of Minecraft.\n\n- I found a problem / have an idea! Do I just post a comment on your CurseForge page?\n  - You **could**, but we'd prefer it if you posted an issue on [our GitHub repository's issue tracker](https://github.com/RandomMcSomethin/fallingleaves/issues).  \n    It makes it far easier for us to follow up when developing new versions of this mod.\n\n- Can I include this mod in my modpack?\n  - Absolutely! Just remember to put a link to our CurseForge page somewhere in your modpack's documentation.\n\n- What do you get if you jumble the letters in \"Falling Leaves Mod\"?\n  - You get \"Five Golden Llamas\". We're still not sure if this means anything in particular...","published":"2021-01-28T16:09:11.540414Z","updated":"2024-06-03T11:27:09.153377Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2057039,"followers":2553,"categories":["decoration"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","21w41a","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["Lz5UGUqe","qBn758ZA","xQRdGvDT","QTn4WxFz","Vx5ygkPc","mqyNUioD","gqfXCbT3","oHAko2xm","RdpuJfjg","a7SgCh8W","KlJ03K3I","FaCaUOFs","jPEjJST0","dWryIdUY","uFJKVYDV","XiehU3ne","7bo5KA2S","aufE28Na","nlfT2jHV","SjhvzbUC","n7dcLucW","bSrG4Fxf","ZMbS4EYg","XYq90g2b","OSEfdzSy","HMfGMPn2","8qK6ANpJ","mva7rKdl","KpvXCE2X","PNG0Dp43","flPXaySR","P5urckC8","tdF6zGZX","5wXruaFu"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/WhbRG4iK/icon.gif"},"version":{"id":"flPXaySR","project_id":"WhbRG4iK","author_id":"INxNlPeV","featured":false,"name":"1.15.6","version_number":"1.15.6+1.20.1","changelog":"Allow controlling the spawn rate of vanilla Cherry Petals!  \n(Actually added in 1.15.5 - completely forgot about it!)\n\n- don't save default leaf block settings\n- fix a typo","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-06T12:04:34.460041Z","downloads":295323,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"9950aaea2a33b1cfc972e881c533384e3bb0a0fb","sha512":"9a335ccb81b4511c073dc4cc687a4bdbeb2aec5f8735da6032096d13e90a81b98912dd96cafed885ea4b9d30d5e44fa4d2dda185009164b285f297f021da4e78"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/WhbRG4iK/versions/flPXaySR/fallingleaves-1.15.6%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"fallingleaves-1.15.6+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":156773,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"sv3saz9X","user":{"id":"n4QH7y5y","username":"BrekiTomasson","name":"Breki Tomasson","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7026735?v=4","bio":"- Lead developer at TankerTrackers.com \r\n- Always juggling 20-something programming projects \r\n- <3 clean code & good code hygiene.\r\n- Java, PHP, NodeJS","created":"2021-01-28T07:40:11.099939Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"sv3saz9X","user":{"id":"INxNlPeV","username":"Fourmisain","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8464472?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-24T22:05:23.378029Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"sv3saz9X","user":{"id":"GHOKC5y2","username":"randommcsomethin","name":"Adam Malkovitch","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34224353?v=4","bio":"Chief Egg Officer of the refridgerator","created":"2021-03-22T20:48:30.163379Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"fallingleaves-1.15.6+1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\ShowMeWhatYouGot-1.20-1.1.1.jar":{"sha512":"af08c3e83f885f51a5d881cf71a376790e7b20f43e488f3622a5280a1bf6d038d0abce0490813252d525af17f635fa8102e890276c9035c70c4663650f8db069","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"jTUiUpsh","slug":"show-me-what-you-got","project_type":"mod","team":"OvmQxHc9","title":"Show Me What You Got","description":"Allows displaying your items in chat.

all surfaces and be physically connected to any solid block no matter the shape.\n- By shift-clicking on a Label with an item you'll be able to change its image, showing that item you selected.\n- Clicking on a Label will let the player interact with the block behind, making it perfect for your storage systems.\n- Images shown by Labels are pixelated and colored to better fit Minecraft style. This works seamlessly for any item.\n- Can accept Glow Ink Sacks to make then glow in the dark.\n- Can be colored with any dye.\n- Using a Feather on them will display the item name.\n- Visuals can he heavily customized with the configs and texture packs.\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

It has a dedicated [online editor](https://puffish.net/skillsmod/editor/) to help building skills layout. There is also an API which allows extending the functionality and managing skills.\n\n## Latest changes (Important)\n\nIn the recent update the mod was split, the core part is [Pufferfish's Skills](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/puffish-skills). Attributes are a separate mod [Pufferfish's Attributes](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/puffish-attributes). The default skill trees were also removed, but can still be downloaded as a data pack [Default Skill Trees](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/default-skill-trees).\n\n## Getting started\n\nThe easiest way is to download [Default Skill Trees](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/default-skill-trees) data pack. You can modify it according to your needs. Most skills in that trees increase player attributes. In the game there isn't many of them and that's why there is a [Pufferfish's Attributes](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/puffish-skills) mod which used to be a part of the mod.\n\n## Commands\n\n`/puffish_skills points add <player> <category> <count>` - Adds points.\n\n`/puffish_skills points set <player> <category> <count>` - Sets points.\n\n`/puffish_skills experience add <player> <category> <amount>` - Adds experience.\n\n`/puffish_skills experience set <player> <category> <amount>` - Sets experience.\n\n`/puffish_skills skills unlock <player> <category> <skill>` - Unlocks skill.\n\n`/puffish_skills skills reset <player> <category>` - Locks all skills, points are refunded.\n\n`/puffish_skills category lock <player> <category>` - Locks category.\n\n`/puffish_skills category unlock <player> <category>` - Unlocks category.\n\n`/puffish_skills category erase <player> <category>` - Resets points, experience, skills.\n\n## Default keybindings\n\n`k` - Opens skills screen.\n\n## Configuration\n\nConfiguration is JSON driven. It is possible to reload in without restarting game using `/reload` command.\n\nTo easily edit skills you can use [online editor](https://puffish.net/skillsmod/editor/).\n\nYou can read more about configuration in the [documentation](https://puffish.net/skillsmod/docs/).\n\n## Compatibility\n\nThis mod supports both Forge and Fabric. What's more it is cross-compatible, so the client can use different loader than the server.\n\nThis mod should not conflict with other mods. Please report an issue if you find an incompatibility.\n\n## Versions\n\nVersions that are maintained and will receive future updates: 1.18.2, 1.19.2, 1.19.4, 1.20, 1.20.2 1.20.4.\n\n## Modpacks\n\nYou can use this mod in your modpack as long as you do not redistribute this mod.\n\n## Community-made tutorials\n\n<details>\n\t<summary>Videos</summary>\n\t<iframe

Lithography.</i>\n</center>\n\n---\n\n### Player Usage\n\n> *Surveyor is a library for map mod developers! You shouldn't need to download it alone.*\n\n#### Commands\n\n* `/surveyor` - display information about your map exploration, including sharing.\n* `/surveyor share [username]` - request/accept sharing map exploration with a player.\n* `/surveyor unshare` - stop sharing map exploration (leave your \"sharing group\")\n\n#### Configuration\n\n* `ticksPerFriendUpdate` - how often to sync the position of sharing players to eachother (server)\n* `shareAll{type}` - whether to ignore exploration and show all available data when possible.\n\n---\n\n### Library Features\n\n**Surveyor relieves the scanning, saving, and networking responsibilities from dependent map mods.**\n\nIn general, Surveyor:\n* Records terrain, structure, and \"landmark\" data suitable for maps as the world is changed.\n* Enables live map sharing between players by tracking individual exploration of the map.\n* Sends the client structures as they're discovered or shared.\n* Syncs map data and landmarks (e.g. waypoints) when sharing or on client data loss.\n* Exposes a generic API for map mod integrations (e.g. adding map markers to important locations).\n* Only adds 2-5% to save size, using an efficient format both in-memory and on-disk.\n\nSurveyor's data **deliberately preserves key details**, designed to allow any abitrary map mod to use it:\n* Terrain is a top-down view of blocks with height, biome, light level, and water depth.\n* Terrain contains multiple layers, allowing for usable cave and nether maps.\n* Structures have IDs, pieces, tags, and even full piece NBT for smaller structures intact.\n* Landmarks generically represent other positional map data - e.g. waypoints, POIs, or faction claims.\n\n---\n\n**Notice: Surveyor is still in early releases.**\n* The API might break several times during 0.x\n* The networking format will break several times during 0.x.\n* The save format will likely break on the change to 1.x\n* Javadoc is very limited\n\n---\n\n## Developers\n\n```groovy\nrepositories {\n    maven { url 'https://repo.sleeping.town/' }\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    modImplementation 'folk.sisby:surveyor:0.3.0+1.20'\n    include 'folk.sisby:surveyor:0.3.0+1.20'\n}\n```\n\n#### Examples\n\n* **[Antique Atlas 4](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas)** - A stylized client-side map mod.\n* **[SurveyorSurveyor](https://github.com/HestiMae/surveyor-surveyor)** - An enhanced-vanilla style java map image generator, using raw surveyor save files.\n* **[Surveystones](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-fwaystones)** - A mixed-side addon that automatically adds landmarks for waystones from [Fabric Waystones](https://modrinth.com/mod/fwaystones/versions).\n\n### Core Concepts\n\nThe **World Summary** holds all of surveyor's data for a world. It can be accessed using `WorldSummary.of(World)`.\n\n**Chunk Summaries** (or the \"Terrain Summary\") represent the world viewed from above. This includes the top layer of blocks, along with their biome, height, block light level, and the depth of water above them.\n\n**Structure Summaries** represent an in-world structure (called `StructureStart` in yarn) - they include map-critical information for identifying the structure and its pieces, but not any actual blocks or piece NBT.\n\n**Landmarks** are a way to represent all other positional information on-map. They have unique serialization per-type, and are uniquely keyed by their type and position to prevent overlaps.\n\n**Exploration** is a record of what chunks, structures, and landmarks a player should be able to see.<br/>\nA player explores a chunk when they're sent it, explores a structure when they stand in (or look at) one of its pieces, and explores an (unowned) landmark when they've explore the chunk it's in. \n\n### Terrain Summary Layers\n\nTo facilitate cave mapping, Surveyor records the top layer of blocks at **multiple height levels** (layer heights).\n\n**The Overworld** scans for floors in these layers:\n* 257-319 - usually empty\n* 62-256 - surface terrain\n* 0-61 - sea floors and riverbeds, ravines, and caves\n* -64-0 - deepslate caves\n\n**The Nether** scans for floors in these layers:\n* 127-255 - usually flat bedrock\n* 71-126 - high caves and outcrops\n* 41-70 - mid-level outcrops and walkways\n* 0-40 - the lava sea and shores\n\nRoughly speaking, Surveyor will accept any non-clear solid block below a 2-high walk-space as a floor.<br/>\nIt will also detect \"carpets\" (non-clear non-solid blocks) above these floors and use those instead.\n\nSurveyor supports any layer height configuration, but currently lacks the API/config to change this for specific dimensions.\n\nNote that the amount of layers doesn't affect how mods display the map, only how often cave floors will be occluded by floors above them.\n\n### Map Mods\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to show the map mod guide</summary>\n\nQuick reminder that surveyor should **replace any existing world scanning logic**<br/>\nYou should never need to look at the currently loaded chunks - If some information is missing, let us know!\n\n#### Initial Setup\n\nClient map mods should always use `SurveyorClientEvents` - this ensures only explored areas will be provided in singleplayer.\n\nTune into `WorldLoad` and queue up the provided keys for rendering.<br/>\nThis event will trigger when the client world has access to surveyor data and the player is available.\n\n`terrain` contains all available chunks by region. `WorldTerrainSummary.toKeys()` converts this into ChunkPos.<br/>\n`structures` contains all structure starts by key + ChunkPos.<br/>\n`landmarks` contains all landmarks (POIs, waypoints, death markers, etc.) by type + BlockPos.\n\nYou can get these from the world summary later using `keySet()` methods - check the event implementation.<br/>\nPass in `SurveyorClient.getExploration()` to ensure unexplored areas are hidden.\n\n##### Live Updates\n\nAlso tune into `TerrainUpdated`, `StructuresAdded`, `LandmarksAdded` to add to your render queues.<br/>\nThese fire whenever the client player should see something new (usually via exploration).<br/>\nThey can also fire before `ClientPlayerLoad`, so let any of them create your map data.\n\nTune into `LandmarksRemoved` as well but without a queue - just remove from your map/queue directly.\n\n#### Terrain Rendering\n\nFirst, generate a top layer (with any desired height limits) using `get(ChunkPos).toSingleLayer()`.<br/>\nThis will produce a raw layer summary of one-dimensional arrays:\n* **exists** - True where a floor exists, false otherwise - where false, all other fields are junk.\n* **depths** - The distance of the floor below your specified world height. so y = worldHeight - depth.\n* **blocks** - The floor block. Indexed per-region via `getBlockPalette(ChunkPos)`.\n* **biomes** - The floor biome. Indexed per-region via `getBiomePalette(ChunkPos)`.\n* **lightLevels** - The block light level directly above the floor (i.e. the block light for its top face). 0-15.\n* **waterDepths** - How deep the contiguous water above the floor is.\n  * All other liquid surfaces are considered floors, but water is special-cased.\n  * The sea floor (e.g. sand) is recorded, and this depth value indicates the water surface instead.\n  * This allows maps to show water depth shading, but also hide water completely if desired.\n\nAll arrays can be indexed by `x * 16 + z`, where x and z are relative to the chunk.<br/>\nUse these arrays to render and store map data for that chunk (pixels, buffers, whichever).<br/>\nRemember that you'll be rendering hundreds of thousands of chunks here - optimize this process hard.\n\n#### Structure Rendering\n\nAlong with the key and ChunkPos, you can get the type and any tags using `getType(key)` and `getTags(key)`.\n\nYou can access a full summary of the structure (e.g. to draw its bounding boxes) using `get(key, ChunkPos)`.<br/>\nThis includes piece data like boxes, direction, IDs, etc.\n\n#### Landmark Rendering & Management\n\nAlong with the type and BlockPos, you can get a full landmark using `get(type, BlockPos)`.\n\nBy default, this can include a dye color, a text name, the owner's UUID, and a texture (could be from another map mod).<br/>\nYou should have a method of rendering a landmark using just this information.\n\nTo improve how landmarks are displayed, you can use `instanceof` to check for additional data, e.g. `HasBlockBox`.\n\nTo add a waypoint landmark, just make a `SimplePointLandmark` owned by the player and use `put(Landmark)`.<br/>\nThis will save to disk and send a copy to the server.\n\n#### Player Rendering\n\nYou can use `SurveyorClient.getFriends()` to get a set of players to draw on the map.\n\nThis includes both the client player, online \"friends\" (map sharing group members), and offline friends.\n\nThe players are represented abstractly, providing UUID, username, global position, yaw, and online status.\n\n</details>\n\n### Landmark Integrations\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to show the landmark integration guide</summary>\n\nLandmark types can be registered via the registry in `Landmarks`.<br/>\nThis allows you to set and serialize custom data relevant to your landmark.<br/>\nYour landmark can usually be a record. Check the [builtins](https://github.com/sisby-folk/surveyor/tree/1.20/src/main/java/folk/sisby/surveyor/landmark) for an example.\n\nTo make extra landmark data accessible to map mods, always declare a new `Has` interface to access it from.\n\nTo place a landmark, just use `WorldSummary.of(world).landmarks().put(Landmark)`.<br/>\nThis works fine on either side - adding a landmark on the server will send it to the client and vice-versa.\n\nLandmark types can't yet have fallback types - so use a simple type (or PR a new one!) if your mod is only on one side.\n\n</details>\n\n## Afterword\n\nAll mods are built on the work of many others.\n\n**Special thanks to:**<br/>\n[Ampflower](https://github.com/Ampflower), [Falkreon](https://github.com/falkreon), [Garden](https://modrinth.com/user/GardenSystem), [Kat](https://git.sleeping.town/Kat), [Solo](https://github.com/solonovamax), [Crosby](https://github.com/RacoonDog), [Lemma](https://github.com/LemmaEOF), [Leo](https://github.com/leo60228), [Jasmine](https://github.com/jaskarth), [Aqua](https://github.com/Aquaeyes), [Wonder](https://git.sleeping.town/wonder), [Infinidoge](https://github.com/Infinidoge), [Emi](https://github.com/emilyploszaj), and [Una](https://github.com/unascribed).\n\nWe're open to suggestions for how to implement stuff better - if you see something wonky and have an idea - let us know.\n","published":"2024-02-15T21:50:06.628048Z","updated":"2024-05-04T03:25:21.746038Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":10009,"followers":11,"categories":["library","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["G7yiYmdP","qZqJavIc","z6rTtwy4","thclVMza","jvqLNmfh","pqrewXQ6","JJZr1nWD","PK9Dnwmg","F6SI2AqH","yFIk1BSU","XY7R0aLa","iB95l6xr","Svu5XJei","q0TDcX7R","pOFLqQYd","abqJkwZu","lSuEK3Qk","9LZLKkUZ","2kcUOf6R","ToQX3y7u","Gs4HHGKk","NMwiULlA","FNrURcop","DiMRJZR0","Mh5TMYYF","3okscgct","PKlX5eZ0","9PDtIAYa","MBzbDvzg","lccVUTKc","9EiJavn5","WD6WwHgN","bSj62HYA","8zAMqx8G","DgG4FAoM","6FiBLVBm","9oaHgfop","vUeAFgnk","mo2UW8l8","ImVWhsca","9Tb96A23","odgvEsTN","MMlTYR3o","Re4dYq2K","XEVCX0iv","L19RgRxx","orXiU2jb","F5yCTpXM","dbEHbHsg","8adSP7xO","emvKJ1K7","aTNbDNeZ","jjmzopIV","1pF8iB3i","SSSTXSFZ","ZfKgvTmg","Si2omTFC","o2xnaZmr","nlf0DnKX","iPaif6xl","RF2eHxbY","iUwiNxuy","bTdzLWsA","tlYqdA9v","owsl7EvW","rGicBaRK","dGer0IkA","gB0aCUY3","Glx87MJn","tUfwS4Bo"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4KjqhPc9/2a6a46267b293a60d2cc30c0225850e863d7b73c.png"},"version":{"id":"tUfwS4Bo","project_id":"4KjqhPc9","author_id":"HrZk20E5","featured":false,"name":"0.5.0","version_number":"0.5.0+1.20","changelog":"Changes:\n- Record the block light level at the surface of the water above submerged floors (a.k.a \"glint\")\n  - This is required for accurate transparent water rendering.\n\nChangelog: https://github.com/sisby-folk/surveyor/releases/tag/v0.5.0","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-04T03:25:22.492471Z","downloads":3742,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"d400446f54fe7788044d0df9b50ea4ba4a5fa9af","sha512":"5a2ca0a3a401026e18881ed4a42fbc75dcdbbd96eeaf022075c963887aa98a05523dea20f52860b94d508afdce803416032dfa2b8a7462e4e18646dc72c208c3"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4KjqhPc9/versions/tUfwS4Bo/surveyor-0.5.0%2B1.20.jar","filename":"surveyor-0.5.0+1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":475380,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"rSrmGeeJ","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"yxiN3YOX","user":{"id":"HrZk20E5","username":"sisby-folk","name":"Nora H","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/HrZk20E5/icon.png","bio":"A handful of technicolor monsters.\n\nDiscord: Unascribed's guild, Prism\n\nPublic: tech.lgbt/@sleepingdragoninn\n\nPrivate: sleepingdragoninn (at) gmail","created":"2021-04-17T05:28:15.123494Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"surveyor-0.5.0+1.20.jar"},"mods\\EchoChest-v8.0.0-1.20.1-Fabric.jar":{"sha512":"2dcfca99acaec0ad851ef10b238911d934f11f295ac78886d43561685e5260ecca341c548939ca216137f6375604faddeee704f56f8beca5caf5878cf576dfc5","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"m3pkVbY8","slug":"echo-chest","project_type":"mod","team":"E0MSCseF","title":"Echo Chest","description":"A unique chest that collects all items dropped nearby.

client-side Minecraft mod that adds colorful and customizable loot beams to dropped items!\n\nLoot Beams are added to all items by default and they change colors depending on the items name. You can, however, specify a whitelist/blacklist for Beams, color overrides, and even NBT tags to change their color! (like `\"lootbeams.color:\"0xFFFFFF\"`).\n\nBeams also have nametags that show up when looking at an item or crouching so you can see what an item is without even picking it up.

JEI will be hidden.\n\n## What does EMI bring to the table?\n\nOf course EMI comes with every feature you'd come to expect from the outset, viewing recipes, favoriting items, searching, and the like. But what's new that EMI offers?\n\n* A craftable mode for **quickly crafting** any recipes you're able to make, usable by toggle or as a config for empty searches\n* **Recipes** can be **favorited** with items, and also can be used to quickly craft at a button press\n* A **recipe tree** for breaking down the cost of a complex craft, showing you **every step**, how many **base ingredients** you need, and what you'll have leftover\n* A **recipe tree crafting mode**, counting up the materials and steps you need to be complete to finish a task, including **synthetic favorites** in your sidebar you can use to **craft every step** for exactly as much as you need\n* Smart display of **tags**, with translations, models, and tooltips, showing you ingredients at a glance, such as \"Planks\" instead of slowly rotating through every plank in the game.\n* Smart breakdowns of base costs, letting recipe trees automatically break down to base ingredients, and letting you define **your own defaults** as you play\n* **Tooltips** for recipes, tags, and ingredients showing you what will be crafted, and what makes up an ingredient\n* Binds for quick crafting **straight into your inventory or cursor**, one or many at a time, in conjunction with recipes favorites or the craftable mode\n* A **clean** and **modern** API, built from the ground up to be simple, powerful, and suit all of EMI's features\n* **Zero third party dependencies**. EMI only requires standard, first party Fabric/Quilt APIs\n\n\n## What does EMI stand for?\nIt doesn't, it's not an acronym. Or maybe it's an acronym without a meaning? If it makes you more comfortable, you can pick one from the list below, or make your own up.\n\n* Emi Memy Imi\n* Exhaustively Many Items\n* Explicitly Mandated Items\n* Endless Material

href=\"https://axiom.moulberry.com/\">https://axiom.moulberry.com/</a></h3>\nBy installing Axiom, you agree to the EULA available at <a href=\"https://axiom.moulberry.com/eula\">https://axiom.moulberry.com/eula</a>\n</center>\n\n---\n\n<br>\n\n**Axiom** is an all-in-one tool for Minecraft editing. It merges the capabilities of 3D software with a sleek interface and an innovative toolset. Axiom simplifies Minecraft building while elevating its potential. Real-time previews and client-side rendering, powered by specialized algorithms, enhance both visual feedback and performance while building. \nNOTE: Axiom works normally alongside FAWE and VS once the plugin is installed on the server. It does not break these existing plugins.\n\n### Support the Project\nBy backing the project or acquiring a commercial license, you play a direct role in supporting Axiom's development, ensuring that we can keep delivering new features and updates.\n\nPatrons get early access to future releases of Axiom and get to vote on upcoming features.\n\n<center>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/moulberry\">\n<img alt=\"Support us on Patreon\" height=\"48\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy/donate/patreon-plural_vector.svg\"></a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/moulberry\">\n<img alt=\"paypal-plural\" height=\"56\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy/donate/paypal-plural_vector.svg\"></a>\n</center>\n\n## Features\nAxiom provides a comprehensive toolset for real-time and detailed Minecraft world adjustments. Each tool is equipped with unique settings tailored for precision.\n\n### Builder Mode\nEnhances vanilla Creative mode with Builder Mode's suite of enhancements:\n\n- **Builder Context Menu**: Hold 'Left Alt' to access a range of features such as **Capabilities** and **Builder Tools**.\n- **Hotbar Swapper**: Switch between hotbars for easier building material management.\n- **Capabilities**: Toggle various building functionalities that will enhance building in various ways so you build whatever, whenever.\n- **Flight Speed**: A convenient slider to adjust your flight speed, with speeds up to 10x.\n\n### Editor Mode\nPress Right-Shift to enter the Editor Mode. Explore a range of tools ideal for world manipulation, painting, terraforming, and sculpting. The Editor Mode integrates familiar camera controls from 3D software with tailored tools for Minecraft building. Customize the UI layout by rearranging windows to suit your needs.\n\n- **Selection Tools**:\n        Innovative selection methods, including magic and cuboid options.\n        Use boolean logic for enhanced selection capabilities.\n- **Painting Tools**:\n        Replace blocks seamlessly without just adding new ones.\n        Choose from a variety of tools for specific block editing needs.\n- **Drawing Tools**:\n        Sculpt and mold your world with an array of tools.\n        Benefit from distinct placement algorithms for different effects.\n- **Heightmap Tools**:\n        Modify terrains using a layered approach, inspired by tools like World Machine.\n- **Manipulation Tools**:\n        Fine-tune terrains for your desired outcome.\n        Smooth, distort, and refine using a series of specialized tools.\n\n\n## Commercial Use\nWe ask that 'Professional Builders' (i.e. people who make money through building in Minecraft)\npurchase a Commercial License. The commercial license unlocks the full potential of Axiom to power your commercial endeavours and provides several extra features such as:\n\n- **Multiplayer Support**:\n        Collaborate with others on private build servers using Multiplayer Support\n- **Custom Server APIs**:\n        Leverage powerful server APIs like serverside custom blocks to accelerate development\n- **Automatic History Persistence**:\n        Automatically back up any changes to the world made by Axiom\n\nIn order to enable the above functionality, Axiom sends a request with your UUID to https://axiom.moulberry.com/.\n\n*And more to come! Axiom is constantly updating. Additional Commercial License features will be available soon.*\n\n## How to Install\nHere is a simple video that guides you through the installation process of Axiom.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qXsEkrVA6Y8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## Links\nYou can follow the project on other socials listed here.\n\n<center>\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AxiomTool\">\n<img alt=\"twitter-plural\" height=\"56\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy/social/twitter-plural_vector.svg\">\n</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@AxiomMinecraftTool/featured\">\n<img alt=\"youtube-plural\" height=\"56\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy/social/youtube-plural_vector.svg\">\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://axiom.moulberry.com/weblate/\">\n<img alt=\"weblate\" height=\"56\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy/translate/weblate_vector.svg\">\n</a>\n</center>\n\n### For Developers\nAxiom has a Client API which can be used to create new tools or add features to the mod which can be found on the [Axiom Client API Github](https://github.com/Moulberry/AxiomClientAPI/).

Fight a now much stronger Ender Dragon with multiple phases, increased health, and new attacks. Through other additions like longer lasting dragon breath and elegant particle animations, the Ender Dragon fight is now much more intense and more satisfying to beat.\n\n**Difficulty:** Damage from the True Ending Ender Dragon is scaled by difficulty, so if you're looking for a greater challenge, set your world's game mode to Hard. This also works by making the fight easier with Easy mode.\n\n# Boss Music\n\nTrue Ending adds boss music to the Ender Dragon boss fight! If you're using the datapack version, you'll have to [download the resource pack by clicking here](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/true-ending-ender-dragon-music). Mod users won't have to install the resource pack as its already nicely installed along the mod jar file.\n\n# Settings\n\n\n\n\nYou can configure multiple settings in True Ending, like the Ender Dragon's health, through its settings menu by using `/function true_ending:_settings` in chat.\n\n# All Features\n \n<details>\n  <summary>Show All Additions and Changes</summary>\n\n- Ender Dragon Health has increased from 200 HP to 300 HP\n- During the Ender Dragon boss fight, boss music now plays to all players at the center island\n- Ambient particles now surround the arena and players during the Ender Dragon fight\n- Added a dragon dive attack that creates a huge shockwave when the Ender Dragon hits the ground\n - Additionally, a variant where it performs 3 dives (Triple Dive) when perching at 75% health or lower\n- Added a chain fired Dragon Fireball attack\n- Added a huge laser attack\n- Added a final phase where the Ender Dragon hovers above the ground for the player to levitate and deal the last blow mid air.\n- Caged end crystal towers are now broken in a more intuitive way: A phantom guards it and when the phantom is killed, the cage is broken\n- At 10% HP the Ender Dragon will be immune to damage till perched. If not already perched or about to perch, it will forcefully perch after 30 seconds\n- Added an End Crystal counter when an End Crystal is broken displaying how many are left to break\n- Everyone within 128 blocks of the center end island now receives the \"Free the End\" advancement after defeating the Ender Dragon\n- Ender Dragon respawn animation revamped\n- When the Ender Dragon is respawned, a sound is played globally to all players in the end dimension\n- Added an animation for entering and leaving the end\n- Dragon Breath/Area Effect Clouds from Dragon Fireballs duration increased from 30 seconds to 1 minute\n- Dragon Fireballs now deal damage directly on impact\n- Dropped Ender Pearls break from new Ender Dragon attacks (this is to prevent obtaining massive amounts of Ender Pearls from the Enderman killed during the fight)\n- Ender Dragon knockback resistance has been increased massively to prevent arrows from locking the dragon mid-air before perching\n- End Crystal fire is now soul fire\n\n\n\n</details>\n\n***\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/748244223903400028/1140023710221353071/Untitled2576_20230812164702.PNG)](https://youtu.be/gmK0zj07qsE)\n\n![Replace this with a description](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/3a81bec138c36a57ea937c23d3478ecf01de0426.png)\n\nJoin the Discord Server to chat, discuss, and get help with my mods!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/XZVARKkjwt\n\n![image](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/52b59c5fe6e8fa9108d478bf6f9df7e9e1e5a7b4.png)\n\nHelp support the making of my datapacks with memberships or donations on Ko-fi!\n\nhttps://ko-fi.com/limesplatus/tiers\n","published":"2023-08-08T01:36:55.613852Z","updated":"2024-03-10T15:45:21.027267Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":220427,"followers":410,"categories":["magic","mobs"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["datapack","fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["V1LSScMv","vJVSTOyx","q6h5YRIp","BTFeD4hC","I8b1haoH","9kV8VNIq","NCHwQgff","Bq69CyS2","hbfWC9lK","pTrPrv3a","nk0GxBIA","aTS9qbQh","hGZ5IWji","gwa2Atr1","yeXHljEt","jzqnt2VV","hftfsOtY","idjGPflj","TNrWJqWs","ICaor2G2","reTqSC7O","TO1g4SDa"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/MCnBYP0b/19e79e0859e608cdb1cba8052da133bf68a3e803.png"},"version":{"id":"TO1g4SDa","project_id":"MCnBYP0b","author_id":"6gUWVwiH","featured":false,"name":"[1.20.x] 1.1.0c Mod","version_number":"1.1.0c+mod","changelog":"- Dragon breath should now correctly do area damage on 1.20.2-1.20.4","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-10T15:45:21.759467Z","downloads":47386,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"ab318879312d428eda430006efd14911a15ddd44","sha512":"4b4bc616a823fca5e91dd149464f2a92b18797cd4f1517bab73b45a77e2337d480c858a1297ee1bb2e44725725e817e59f904e33df62b32d0b7a2b3fffe92ebd"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/MCnBYP0b/versions/TO1g4SDa/tru.e-ending-v1.1.0c.jar","filename":"tru.e-ending-v1.1.0c.jar","primary":true,"size":5525883,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"ZltblCOt","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Y2cdJ6mq","user":{"id":"6gUWVwiH","username":"limesplatus","name":"SpluoSplatus","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/6gUWVwiH/3fe0c6b15dce11cc51850252a3791b01a892c25a.png","bio":"drawing and making minecraft datapacks //\ngreen is awesome","created":"2022-11-24T17:38:32.819656Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"tru.e-ending-v1.1.0c.jar"},"mods\\lambdynamiclights-2.3.2+1.20.1 (1).jar":{"sha512":"4870953196e22d02844b76fdcae29823922401a5b238d134374308a256a7ffcfb9f087369fc0ec23b5cb218b995d2efa6f60ac0b99fbf9b298ee7ffbb4f6937a","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"yBW8D80W","slug":"lambdynamiclights","project_type":"mod","team":"BEQmFKFk","title":"LambDynamicLights","description":"A dynamic lights mod for Fabric.","body":"# LambDynamicLights\n\n\n[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights?style=flat-square)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/1.19/LICENSE)\n![Environment: Client](https://img.shields.io/badge/environment-client-1976d2?style=flat-square)\n[![Mod loader: Fabric]][fabric] \n\nA dynamic lights mod for Quilt and Fabric.\n\n## 📖 What's this mod?\n\nIt's dark outside, extremely dark...\nYou can't see a lot in the darkness, you wish you had a torch,\nor a lantern to hold and see in the light...\n\nAnd this is now possible with this mod as it adds dynamic lights to the game.\nYou can see in the darkness thanks to your torch now!\n\nThis mod adds dynamic lights to Minecraft. Dynamic lights are lights created by an entity holding an\nitem which makes light as a block, or created by an entity on fire, etc.\n\n[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8r1TNG45tM?wmode=transparent)\n\nSearching other mods to replace OptiFine? [Check out this list!](https://optifine.alternatives.lambdaurora.dev/)\n\n## ✅ Features:\n\n- Dynamic lights.\n- Settings to select how smooth the dynamic lighting is.\n- Works with some modded items.\n- Any entity holding an item which emits light will emit light!\n- Magma cubes emit light.\n- Spectral arrows emit light.\n- Burning entities emit light.\n- Blazes emit light.\n- Some items like torches, soul torches, etc. will not light up in water.\n- Quick and simple API for developers.\n- And more!\n\n## Screenshots\n\n### Items emit light\n\nDropped items which already emit light as a block, will also dynamically emit light!\n\n![Torch](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/21/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Held items emit light\n\nLight is emitted when entities hold light emitting items.\n\n![Fox holding lantern](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/22/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Fire!

Come check out [my Discord server][LambdAurora Discord].\n\n\n\n## 📖 How does it work internally?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/HOW_DOES_IT_WORK.md).\n\n## 📖 Is there an API? How to use it as a developer?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/API.md).\n\n# 📖 Compatibility\n\n- [Sodium] is recommended for better performances.\n- [Canvas] is compatible but still WIP: expect huge lag spike with it until a proper lighting API is done in Canvas.\n- **OptiFabric is obviously incompatible.**\n\n\n**<p

integrated vanilla-friendly collection of new dungeons and structures","body":"![](https://i.imgur.com/xHsKaPT.jpg)  \n\n### ⛺ About\n**Explorify** is a mod with new structures to generate and explore in your Minecraft world!  \n\nThe new structures don't only look fairly good (as good as I can make them :P) but should also fit the game thematically and structurally. They're not meant to be just some houses or dungeons, but new things that feel new and interesting while not being too out of place. The main goal is to make exploration more interesting, rewarding, but also just to enrich the stale Minecraft world.  \n\nStructures are also made to be well adapted to surrounding terrain, to not create superflat-like terrain or ugly cliffs in your world. And on top of that, they're properly integrated and should be compatible with all kinds of mods!  \n\nThis is a data pack packaged as a mod, meaning it is fully server-side. You can install it on vanilla servers and have vanilla clients join.  \n\nI hope you like it! More structures will get added over time.  \n\n### 📦 Content\nFor a list of structures with descriptions see the gallery!  \n\n### 📝 Notes\nPlease also know that this mod is still in development and new versions may differ significantly. I might make any changes, including the removal of structures. While Minecraft can handle this and updating the mod will not corrupt your world, it's still best to make backups.  \n\n### ⚙ Configuration\nIf you want to adjust the frequency of structures to your liking, you can use a custom data pack. A template is [available here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/explorify/download/4111372) (for versions v1.19-1.2.x). If you want a structure to not generate at all, remove it from the \"structures\" list inside the relevant file.

alt=\"Supplementaries Twitter\"></a>\n\n## 📖About📖\n</center>\n\nSnowy Spirit is a Winter themed mod that adds many decorative blocks & featuresl This mod is highly configurable and all its blocks and items can be tweaked or disabled. Its main features are:\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6lPE3bSGgok\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n### Sleds\n- Sleds are new way to get around Snow. Differently from Boats they curve around the terrain they encounter making them able to smoothly climb up and down slopes.\n- When going downhill they will also accelerate further making ski courses possible.\n- Sleds have improved mobility on Ice and while being able to slide on Snow are still able to steer and you can even bring them to a full stop by rotating the sled by 90 degrees, as you would in real life!\n- Chests can be placed on them to give some inventory space. Also works with Shulker Boxes and Sacks from Supplementaries.\n- You can also attach a tamed Wolf with a Lead to it. When Sleds are pulled by Wolves they will have increase mobility, speed and will be able to climb up with minimal deceleration.\n- Igloos can now spawn with an additional Sled with Chest in front that can contain some sweet winter loot.\n- Sleds can be further customized by placing Carpets on top of them. Doing so will additionally prevent freezing when sledding on top of frigid Powdered Snow.\n\n### Villagers AI\n\n- During winter time villagers will occasionally place down Wreaths on their house doors. They can only place one each and don't worry, they will clean them up when winter is over. Wreath placing can happen during idle time so at around 0 for example.\n- If you have Supplementaries installed villagers will also place down Present blocks containing some cool items. They will only be able to place one Present each and will do so during their meet time (after 9000) around their meeting point.\n- Baby villagers from Taiga and Tundra will throw Snowballs at any entity they see during their play time.\n- \"Winter Time\" is a period of time which can be configured with the provided configs and by default goes from the 20th of December to the 30th of January.\n- If you have Serene Seasons installed you can also make the mod follow its seasons instead.\n\n### Winter themed blocks\n\n- Ginger: a new crop that can be crafted into Gingerbread Blocks, a new decorative block. Wild Ginger can be found in Sparse Jungle biomes.\n- Gumdrops: they come in all colors and can be pushed by entities acting as a mix between a Button and a Pressure Plate that works on all directions.\n- Candy Cane: a sweet looking item, literally. Can be crafted in decorative Candy Cane Blocks.\n- Wreaths: can be placed on doors to bring some Christmasy joy to your house. Works with all modded doors as well.\n- Glow Lights: an item that can be placed on any Leaves to give it some glow in the dark action. Can be removed with Shears or broken.\n- Snow Globe: a block that will change to its snowy state when placed in places where it can snow.\n- New music disc: a new winter themed music disc has been added and can be rarely found in Presents and Igloo Sled Chests.\n\n> This project was made during WinterJam 2021\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

height=\"59\" /><br />\nThe ultimate upgrade to Minecraft's desert temples! YUNG's Better Desert Temples redesigns vanilla desert temples to be way more exciting, adding a variety of new puzzles, traps, &amp; parkour challenges. And of course, you'll get much better loot than vanilla's desert temples for your troubles!\n</p>\n<p>\nBy default, mining fatigue will be applied to all players in the Better Desert Temple. Once you clear the temple (i.e. kill the pharaoh at the end of the temple), the mining fatigue effect for that temple will be permanently lifted! You can disable this feature in the config. Additionally, you can re-enable vanilla desert temples to spawn alongside Better Desert Temples in the config.\n</p>\n<p>\nCloser look: <br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TpkTeTeDKJo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnimated trailer: <br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1C5Z0DaOQk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JR6R3uf.png\" alt=\"Compatibility\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nYUNG's Better Desert Temples is intended to be fully compatible with every worldgen mod, including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Mineshafts\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-mineshafts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Mineshafts</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Strongholds\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-strongholds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Strongholds</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Dungeons\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Dungeons</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Extras\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-extras\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Extras</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Bridges\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-bridges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Bridges</a></li>\n<li>Repurposed Structures.

It focuses on expansion of the content related to swamp biomes. The mod adds new mobs, block, items and structures--old mechanisms lurking in the depths of the wetlands. **BtW** is under active development and more features are to come soon.\n\n[Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and [GeckoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/geckolib) are required.  \n**BtW** is compatible with generation mods, even with those that add new biomes (for the structures to generate in them, names of these biomes must be written manually in the config file).\n\nCurrently **BtW** supports the following languages:\n\n<center>\nEnglish | Polish | Russian | Ukrainian | Pre-reform Russian\n</center>\n<br>\n\nSince the translations may not be 100% and we aim to add more languages, we seek for community help. If you want to translate the mod into the language you speak, feel free to contact us on Discord.\n\n[![Beneath the Wetlands](https://images2.imgbox.com/be/9e/nYM4l4dY_o.png)](https://discord.gg/6hZMsGqHWb)\n\n## Features\n\n### Mobs\n* **Elder Gear Golem** - a mini-boss with different attacks with that can be activated in its dungeon in the swamps\n* **Gear Golem** - a friendly mob that can be built by a player (the same principle as with an iron golem but an animated copper gear needs to be placed on its back)\n* **Will-o'-the-Wisp** - spawns in the swamps at night and starts fleeing as a player approaches\n\n### Blocks and Items\n* **Sapropel Block** - generates on the bottom of the swamps, breaks into several pieces of sapropel\n* **Sapropel** - can be put into a composter for bone meal\n* **Peat and Dry Peat** - as well generates on the bottom of the swamps, can be dried in the furnace and used as fuel\n* **Mire Block** - toxic goo that generates in the swamps in the form of small lakes\n* **Sulfur Nugget** - has a chance to drop out of peat, can be used to craft torches and as a one-time flint and steel\n* **Bog Iron Ore** - generates on the bottom of the swamps\n* **Raw Bog Iron**\n* **Raw Bog Iron Block**\n* **Bog Iron Ingot** - can be re-melted into a common iron ingot\n* **Block of Bog Iron**\n* **Tattered Block of Bog Iron**\n* **Cut Bog Iron, Slab, Stairs**\n* **Sunken Bricks, Slab, Stairs, Wall**\n* **Fume Trap** - redstone-powered block that emits hot fumes\n* **Copper Valve** - essentially works like a lever but can be waterlogged\n* **Bottled Will-o'-the-Wisp** - obtained by clicking on a will-o'-the-wisp with a bottle\n* **Copper Gear** - a decorative block, can't be used in redstone mechanisms\n* **Animated Copper Gear** - used to build a copper golem, can be either crafted with a bottled will-o'-the-wisp and a copper gear or by clicking with the former on the latter\n* **Broken Copper Gear** - an old, oxidized version of a copper gear\n* **Animated Broken Copper Gear** - same as an animated copper gear but is used for activating an elder gear golem\n* **Elder Gear Golem Heart** - drops from an elder gear golem, can be used for crafting an oxidizer\n* **Oxidizer** - launches explosives that damage mobs and oxidize copper blocks\n* **Spawn Eggs** - for every new mob\n\n### Structures\n* **Elder Golem Dungeon** - a rare structure where a player can find resources to build an elder gear golem and fight it\n* **Pipes, cogs, cisterns, pistons, mechanisms** - in many forms\n\n### Other\n* **Advancements**\n* **Swamp Call Sounds** - rarely appear at night in swamp biomes\n* **Config file** - a file with some mod settings that can be tweaked (what biomes the structures generate in, does an elder gear golem have a bossbar)\n* **Some hidden minor mechanics!**\n\n## Authors & Community\n\n**BtW** is created by **Birchfolks**, a team of 3 developers: Neorgothic (art designer), notulum (programmer), xannysnomore (producer).\n\nOur beloved contributers: Maro, The Old Serpent\n\nWe encourage everyone to join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/6hZMsGqHWb), [report bugs](https://github.com/birchfolks/Beneath-the-Wetlands/issues) and take part in translation. Fair use in modpacks and videos is welcomed.\n\n## FAQ\n<details>\n<summary>FAQ</summary>\n\n**Q: What creepypasta this mod is based on?**  \nA: It's a short creepypasta from an image board, you can read it translated into English in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/6hZMsGqHWb).\n\n**Q: What versions of Minecraft are supported?**  \nA: Currently 1.19.2 and 1.20.1. We aim to support the newest versions.\n\n**Q: Can you downgrade this mod to 1.12.2?**  \nA: No. Downgrading a mod is very tedious and some features might break.\n\n**Q: Can you make a Forge version of this mod?**  \nA: Definetely not now or soon. Fabric is much more user- and developer-friendly. But maybe some day.\n\n**Q: Why does updating take so long?**  \nA: There're only three of us and modding isn't our job (unfortunately).

If you want to translate the mod into the language you speak, contact us via the dedicated channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/6hZMsGqHWb).\n\n**Q: Can the structures of this mod generate in the biomes of other mods?**  \nA: Yes, but for this to happen you need to manually put the names of biomes in the config file. We didn't make the structures generate in any swamp biomes by default in case you wouldn't want BtW to interfere with other mods.\n\n**Q: Where can I find the config file?**  \nA: There's a folder in the Minecraft root directory named \"config\", inside of it you can find \"wetlands.json\".\n\n</details>\n\n![Beneath the Wetlands](https://images2.imgbox.com/f1/84/vCXrifcS_o.png)","published":"2023-01-19T16:48:27.700157Z","updated":"2024-02-24T20:41:59.967609Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":89023,"followers":179,"categories":["adventure","mobs","worldgen"],"additional_categories":["decoration"],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.19.3","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["yk1Wq4Cx","GRWlGIZu","GMehVvFm","jNm1sj90","4Aa2mnnC","uQ9cMTeP","jMFHrv8g","vCcbPQlg","SQIs7MJs"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QjzFB2iK/9547ac6b2aae82b06d162f146d02d7679a58676d.png"},"version":{"id":"SQIs7MJs","project_id":"QjzFB2iK","author_id":"EhXk6dF3","featured":true,"name":"Beneath the Wetlands 1.2","version_number":"1.2","changelog":"**NEW CONTENT NEW CONTENT WOOAHH**\n* Elder Gear Golem changed to a mini-boss with different attacks\n* Elder Gear Golem's model and texture changed\n* Gear Golem's model and texture changed\n* Golems' AI completely reworked\n* Structures completely rebuilt\n* Elder Gear Golem dungeon added\n* Sapropel Block and Sapropel added instead of Silt (gets replaced automatically)\n* Broken Copper Gear and Animated Copper Gear added\n* Elder Gear Golem Heart added\n* Oxidizer added\n* Copper Valve added\n* Advancements tweaked\n* New sounds added\n* Config file added with:\n\t* an option to choose biomes for structures to generate in (swamps and mangrove swamps are set by default)\n\t* an option to turn on/off a bossbar of an elder gear golem\n* Polish translations tweaked (thanks to **Maro** from our Discord!)\n* Code refined\n* Other minor changes\n* Major and minor bug fixes\n\nSpecial thanks to **The Old Serpent** from our Discord for introducing a system of structure generation in all biomes that tagged as swamps!

This can be an area, region, zone, town, kingdom etc. This is done with a placed sign. On it you specify the radius, optionally the rgb value and the name. This means that the radius around the sign is now considered an area. Whenever a player enters this area, they receive a message at the top of the GUI with (by default) \"Enter the area.\". And when they leave \"Leaving the area.\". This can both be changed in the config.<br><br>Names are randomly selected when the sign does not contain one. There is a global RGB value for the messages specified in the config, but this can also be a unique value again specified on the sign. See the examples below for a better idea of how it works!<br><br>You can make areas overlap in order to create different area shapes. The join/leave message will only show when entering for the first time or leaving every overlapping zone.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;color:#008000\"><strong>Works in multiplayer, but players must also have the mod installed on their client.</strong></span><br><br><br><strong><span style=\"font-size:20px\">Configurable:</span> <span style=\"color:#008000;font-size:14px\"><a style=\"color:#008000\" href=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.information/wiki/how-to-configure-mods\" rel=\"nofollow\">(&nbsp;how do I configure?&nbsp;)</a></span><br></strong><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>giveUnnamedAreasRandomName</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): When enabled, gives signs without an area name a randomly chosen one from a preset list.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>radiusAroundPlayerToCheckForSigns</strong>&nbsp;(default = 100, min 0, max 1000): The radius in blocks around the player in which to check for area signs.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>defaultAreaRadius</strong>&nbsp;(default = 30, min 0, max 1000): The default radius for areas when it's left empty on the sign.

Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor.

automatic data and resource packs.</p>\n<p>Usually, data packs have to be loaded separately for every world. Paxi adds the <b><em>paxi</em></b> folder in your Minecraft config folder, where you can place data and resource packs that will automatically be loaded for every world. The first time you run Paxi, the <b><em>paxi&nbsp;</em></b>folder will be created for you in your Minecraft config directory.</p>\n\n<p>Paxi is as simple as it gets when it comes to global data and resource packs, making it a great utility for modpack creators!</p>\n\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9VzCAAC.png\" alt=\"Data packs\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nWithin the <em>paxi</em> folder is a <b><em>datapacks</em></b> folder for data packs. This folder will be created for you the first time you create or load a world with Paxi installed. Any data packs placed in this folder will be automatically loaded into any world you play - in other words, globally loaded data packs! When in game, use the command <code>/datapack list</code> to see all loaded data packs; packs loaded by Paxi are printed in pink text. Both zip files and regular folders (containing a pack.mcmeta file) are supported.</p>\n\n<p>\nData packs can also be loaded in a specific order! The first time you create or load a world with Paxi installed, the <em><b>datapack_load_order.json</b></em> file will be created for you in the <em>paxi</em> directory. You can fill this JSON file with a list of data pack folder names (including the .zip for zip files) in the order you want your data packs loaded in. Using this JSON file is entirely optional - any data packs not listed in the file will be loaded normally (alphabetically by folder/zip file name, same as normal data packs). So if you only have a few data packs that require loading in a specific order, you only need to list them in the JSON!</p>\n\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cSWd9iG.png\" alt=\"Resource Packs\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nAlso within the <em>paxi</em> folder is a <em><b>resourcepacks</b></em> folder for resource packs. This folder will be created for you the first time you run the game with Paxi installed. Any resource packs placed in this folder will be automatically loaded when you start the game. Both zip files and regular folders (containing a pack.mcmeta file) are supported. Resource packs are not supported on dedicated servers, since they only affect the game on the client-side (textures, sounds, and other assets).</p>\n\n<p>\nResource packs can also be loaded in a specific order! The first time you create or load a world with Paxi installed, the <em><b>resourcepack_load_order.json</b></em> file will be created for you in the <em>paxi</em> directory. You can fill this JSON file with a list of resource pack folder names (including the .zip for zip files) in the order you want your resource packs loaded in. Using this JSON file is entirely optional - any resource packs not listed in the file will be loaded normally (alphabetically by folder/zip file name, same as normal resource packs).

worlds.\n\n[![Modrinth](https://img.shields.io/modrinth/dt/neruina?colour=00AF5C&label=downloads&logo=modrinth)](https://modrinth.com/mod/neruina)\n[![CurseForge](https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_851046_downloads.svg)](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/neruina)\n\n### When an Entity, Block or Item causes a ticking crash:\n- That Entity will be suspended and no longer tick, you can still interact with the entity but cannot attack it.\n- That Block Entity / Tile Entity or Block State (for random ticks) will no longer tick, you can still access the block inventory if it has one.\n- That Item will stop ticking in the inventory but will still persist and function in recipes and most uses, nothing is lost.\n- If another mod causes the Player to crash on tick, the Player will be kicked instead.\n\n### Actions:\n- `What Is This?`: Opens the Neruina wiki page on what Neruina is and what it does\n- `Copy Crash`: Copies the cause of the ticking exception to your clipboard\n- `Teleport`: Teleports you to the location of the ticking entity\n- `Try Resume`: Attempts to resume the ticking of the ticking entity\n- `Kill`: Immediately kills and removes the ticking entity\n- `Report` (1.19+): Opens a new issue on the [NeruinaAutoReports](https://github.com/Bawnorton/NeruinaAutoReports)\n  GitHub repository and any mods that opt-in to the reporting system\n\n### Persitance:\n- Ticking entity tracking will now persist across server restarts\n- When the world is first started Neruina will broadcast all tracked ticking entities that need addressing\n\n### Ticking Threshold:\n- When a certain number of ticking excpetions occur within a certain time frame, Neruina will deliberately crash in\n  order to prevent the server from becoming unusable.\n- A comprehensive report will be generated with every ticking exception that occurred with instructions on what to do next.\n- The default threshold is 10 exceptions within 5 minutes, this can be changed in the config.\n\n### Config\n- `log_level`\n    - `operators` (default) - Only operators will receive the broadcast\n    - `everyone` - Everyone will receive the broadcast\n    - `disabled` - No one will receive the broadcast\n- `ticking_exception_threshold`\n    - The number of ticking exceptions that can occur within the specified time frame before Neruina will deliberately\n      crash\n    - Default is `10`\n    - `-1` will disable the threshold\n- `auto_kill_ticking_entities`\n    - If true, ticking entities will be immediately killed and removed rather than suspended\n    - Default is `false`","published":"2023-04-16T02:48:09.083100Z","updated":"2024-05-21T16:43:19.213087Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":341847,"followers":104,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["gFDTlYva","t7QqU6GC","lY3XjoiG","1kvaSVPe","k2xYSHIO","s0Dw11BD","uCYnuRfV","9CUCVABQ","qiCyQnQb","cZQv6x9R","1cxZvFaD","6Wc1wySq","B9ZR87Ws","cLR5it0O","HG1IAWMf","1hAuyKqX","si9qadH8","oWCHNF3U","LVF6eEwy","pVycNpLT","UlxWjlxZ","WHuBFrVG","zjq512pk","tH3dA34q","Ks0iPnry","mBMOVCoi","bLF5Xi3z","Vf8rcrxB","En2AbIrY","Z7982UzL","QOVVS868","vpcFLDzA","zQviItAy","fez1lpaX","ZilPnAbb","IoOGXrZ1","AeXDMj50","wz6ptum5","7Y42VogK","RaP3sWWr","VKc0dQJ4","OURXSRYG","iytEhar2","R4xuuYah","q4kZgUJ0","S95lnn83","YvsVgtJ2","QZhmbGqz","NRaf078W","QRFMiKt8","sIshNzcx","wDRTyPHj","u8WsuGwJ","2nvplBOu","SrTIAwZQ","7lTmIUht","jijJTx3Z","Vq3e8M1S","wdRYHrJx","Q1ksFcMU","o4GrNXlp","cYY4Mj5d","I7Nhi02i","DqhEpQbv","urHANUlF","OVr2u4vF","JlUbqvDr","uuag56TA","AoIbdGit","3EFQyMRJ","lOcQOYFd","JgBVA5VC","NBOQHx8s","WQA5VnUe","4gwxcbJj","YuOZXPap","MZGqqctu","a1M6kWHX","tuBdaQtW","kr9Ex4Su","bcLz5Ull","dUDdC3we","8FZtemi0","3nPntExd","9ivXcJEH","a7u1jfbz","TN81ShVx","PUXRPbIv","wY9wiOGP","8VE2LlUq","9EeevciG","7wPr8hZu","fgDP4dFB","Jxl6RWC7","lqxsuFdN","TRHD8nMe","c5XrC7um","ZU4eAFB3","yga9Qdt4","RX1KzV2Y","4a1oclhK","WNFfMYlL","vtjsqmWw","5oomV8Xe","5TMS9aA7","KjoOQWXx","18KACa0v","wyX0svvD","RDIW1vEr","Rgw87vtu","QLfNYD5X","ovhFd4hV","ZnozYXy0","nT0BRNAK","ghtvpiib","eJ0cfUYZ","SOynRYj3","JaWa9t35","zub9vqIu","shEpXbrx","obFkianv","AXts8ZvP","urbxWRwe","HAY2a4EI","FGHbY6b0","YGUJof15","y9EQlZVy","DromPhtS","FeUBkub6","vLvFOyhZ","BPgF33f8","Y8SdXBLm","ltv3yt61","CzQWOO6H","RH7DozdT","wQnrezRp","9WB5CFtn","cGwAoULz","uriuhXDq","9qiHa4tW"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1s5x833P/b7e3cf809f07d3cad88a60834c3e4e7248021744.png"},"version":{"id":"PUXRPbIv","project_id":"1s5x833P","author_id":"2Vv26IAS","featured":false,"name":"Neruina

Conversely, warm-water ships will be 10% faster in warm water biomes but 10% slower in cold water biomes. It's important to note that the speed of the ships will also be affected by the number of cannons on board, reducing speed by 2.5% per cannon. Additionally, cargo on board can decrease the ship's speed by up to 10%.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Sail coloring:</strong> You can customize sails by coloring them with dye items. Simply right-click the ship with the dye in your hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Ship repairing:</strong> You can repair your ship with iron nuggets and planks. Simply right-click the ship with the iron nuggets in your hand, you need to have a good supply of planks in your inventory.</p>\n<p><strong>Ship naming:</strong> You can name your ship with a name-tag. Simply right-click the ship with the name-tag in your hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Leashing:</strong> <strong>Leashing allows players to tether ships. Leashed ships cannot be directly controlled, and only ships without a player on the controller seat can be leashed.</strong><br /><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yhrQyxj.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Cog:</strong></p>\n<p>The Cog is a medieval trade ship used in cold water biomes.

With such a large scope, there will surely be areas where refinement is needed. If you see any such places, please give me your feedback in the comments below or even better on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/yJng7sC44x).\n\n\n# Where is WWOO?\nWe decided to split WWOO in two distinct parts:\n- **Expanded Ecosphere**: This mod includes new biomes and builds upon the old 1.19/1.20 WWOO.\n- **WWOO**: This new project is focused on overhauling the vanilla biomes and is inspired by the style of the old 1.16/1.17 WWOO.\n\nYou can find the WWOO project [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/wwoo).\n\n# Features Expanded Ecosphere\n- Large Biomes! Because of some problems with world presets, you should not use the vanilla world presets. Instead use the forceLargeBiomes option, found in the WWOO config.\n- A config menu is available if you install [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) and on fabric also [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu).\n- The overworld isn't piglin safe. (On datapack it is, so that the Hoglins which can spawn in the overworld don't mutate to Zoglins)\n\n<details>\n  <summary>List of all Biomes</summary>\nExpanded Ecosphere also changes Vanilla biomes.

Tridents</strong> brings some small, but much need improvements to tridents. Especially the loyalty enchantment is much more useful, and there's even a crafting recipe for tridents themselves!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lHSmULI.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Tridents Finally Have A Crafting Recipe!</strong> No longer will you solely receive this ancient weapon from a reskinned zombie: Every noticed how there are three elder guardians in an ocean monument, and a trident has exactly three jags? Well, that's not a coincidence anymore! Each elder guardian will drop a <strong>Trident Fragment</strong>; combine those with a few prismarine shards, and there's your brand new trident!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">But what do you do when your trident is about to run out of durability? Simple: <strong>Repair It With Some Prismarine Shards</strong> using an anvil! Why do you even ask, that's obvious, isn't it?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Let's talk about the loyalty enchantment: So your trident comes back to you, nice. But where does it go? Somewhere in your inventory to dig up again? And when you throw it into the void in the End, it's just gone. And what about all the fancy loot from the mobs you've slain, you need to go over there to collect it. Really? Well, all fixed: Tridents always return to the slot they are thrown from (even without loyalty), when thrown into the void they return, and any loot dropped by mobs will come flying at you together with the trident itself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Besides that, <strong>Impaling Works As It Does On Bedrock Edition</strong>: any mob in contact with water or rain will receive increased damage. This is especially great, since tridents now finally work against those annoying drowneds infesting your beautiful oceans.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lHSmULI.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/491/965/2022-08-31_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/491/966/2022-08-31_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Tridents with loyalty collect all drops for you</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Your trident is damaged?

bounty boards, giving rewards for collecting different blocks and items.","body":"# Bountiful\n\n \n\n#### This requires [Kambrik](https://modrinth.com/mod/kambrik)!\n\n***\n\n#### Bountiful is a mod centered around a single block called the Bounty Board, and items which appear within: Bounties!\n\n***\n\n\n \n\n### Mechanics:\n\nBounty boards can be found throughout the world in villages, and they'll generate bounties inside of them. These bounties often ask for you to bring back an item, or kill some mobs in return for whatever rewards they're offering. If you can complete the bounty, you just have to bring it back to the bounty board and right click the board to redeem your rewards!\n\n\n### Decrees\n\nThere exists another item as well, called a Decree. A Decree determines what kind of bounties show up on a bounty board. For example, an Armorsmith's Decree makes it so that objectives and rewards related to armor show up on the board (leather, iron, chestplates, boots, etc). You can have up to three decrees on a bounty board at once, and it will mix and match objectives and rewards from all three when new bounties appear!\n\nYou can find new Decrees as rewards for certain bounties, or make your own. Crafting your own will create a random decree when you place it onto the board.\n\n### Bounty Tiers\n\nJust like items, bounties can have different tiers of rarity. Some bounty rewards are more rare than others, and bounties with higher rarity have a better chance of having these more rare rewards! Rarity follows the same pattern as in vanilla: Common, Uncommon, Rare and Epic.\n\n### Reputation\n\nAll bounty boards have their own value associated with them called \"Reputation\". As you turn in more bounties, this number goes up! The higher the reputation, the more often rare bounties show up on the bounty board. Some bounty rewards may not even show up until you reach high enough reputations.\n\n### Compat\n\nCurrently, I've added some support for some items from different Fabric mods. Feel free to suggest compat with other Fabric mods (but I may be stingy! For example: I'm not likely to add compat with items that involve a lot of time to craft, since it may break progression for some modpacks).\n\n \n\nI plan on adding more in the future!\n\n### Why?\n\nI originally made this mod so that I could be given some goals to accomplish, which would stave off boredom. It gives players something to do when they're bored, and a fun way to incentivize crafting items they'd otherwise maybe not be making!\n\n### Help\n\nUntil the wiki is complete, you can get help on [my Discord server.](https://discord.gg/TCsRjJ6vwZ)\n\n#### Credits:\n\nAkiShirai, for the wonderful bounty board block art.","published":"2021-08-29T02:15:45.939419Z","updated":"2024-03-04T06:47:13.142048Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":422845,"followers":422,"categories":["adventure","economy","utility"],"additional_categories":["game-mechanics","worldgen"],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.18-pre5","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["b745WfGi","FW2gMFWm","s7W0BcY3","yII7Bu5c","vMLc67VP","hYrrBKBT","qFqfFMMO","j44RssVC","RJHSMTU7","b9dZ8adN","2KAmOHQt"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BpwWFOVM/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"qFqfFMMO","project_id":"BpwWFOVM","author_id":"HpLaZ9DK","featured":false,"name":"Bountiful 6.0.3+1.20.1-Fabric","version_number":"6.0.3+1.20.1","changelog":"### Added\n- Implemented the new item group system, so that items will once again show up in creative tabs, as well as in JEI.\n- Added processor lists, so that bounty boards can generate with a different look depending which village it generates in.\n- Added Numismatic Overhaul compat for Fabric.\n- Updated translations.\n- Added a default single localization override for Decrees\n### Fixed\n- Fixed the \"missing ops\" cosmetic issue upon world load.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-17T23:19:01.980803Z","downloads":320192,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"147065ea9b24a43d11a6b22fec9733f011695f1ce8e164037185eb3e29f6c7c01787f193f6c0b614ff9c83c07db811567e3842afe2c88bbf39dc2664bd2d029d","sha1":"d8e5e67712a8b683ae07101a51ad53df0fb24e63"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BpwWFOVM/versions/qFqfFMMO/Bountiful-6.0.3%2B1.20.1-fabric.jar","filename":"Bountiful-6.0.3+1.20.1-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":529853,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"s7VTKfLA","project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":"s10JMAtS","project_id":"Ha28R6CL","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":"XheZ9iGK","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":"SqVitkHr","project_id":"zfbCkvdZ","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"qvvDCp9U","user":{"id":"HpLaZ9DK","username":"ejektaflex","name":"Ejektaflex","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23628421?v=4","bio":"I write code!

It'll wiggle funny if you hit it, screaming large numbers of damage at you. It can be dressed up to look even more awesome. This will please the dummy, making the numbers smaller.\n\nTL;DR: target dummies show damage dealt to them and can be equipped with armor\n\n \n\nUsage:\nRight click on a block with a target dummy to place it. He can be rotated 16 different directions depending on the way you face when you place it, similar to an armor stand.\n\nYou can start dressing the little dude with all kind of armors and equipment. Just right click him with the desired item. To unequip a certain armor piece just click on his corresponding body part.\n\nGot tired of testing your dps? You can remove the dummy just by shift left clicking him with an empty hand!\n\n \n\nAdditional features:\nHave you ever wanted to test your new smite sword but couldn't because there are no skellies around? Well fear no more, you can now equip the dummy with and undead mob head and it will change its type accordingly!\nSimilarly you can equip him with a turtle helmet to make it a water mob or with a pillager banner to turn it into a pillager mob. Note that he still won't be attacked by other mobs (maybe it a future update), he'll just take more damage from appropriate enchantment and so on.\n\n \n\n Need automating? You can dispense the dummy using a dispenser and you can break him by removing the block under his feet.\n \n\n Don't like how much he swings or the new skin? Well you can easily change that by using the mod config file. You can additionally choose between static and dynamic dps messages and you can make the numbers show hearths instead of damage.\nTry shearing the dummies to get a different skin!\n\n \n\nYou can also equip them with a pumpkin or jack o lantern and they'll act as scarecrows, scaring nearby animals\n \n\n \n\nFull list of changes from original 1.12 bonusboni's mod:\n \n\nLots of stuff here, more than half of the mod was re written.\n\nNew skin!\nAdded support for more than one damage number. They now have a fading animation to clarify which is the newest.\nNumbers change their colors depending on the type of damage dealt. For example critical hits are red and lightning damage is yellow. Try it out!\nAdded dispenser support\nCan mimic mob types by equipping different items.\nUpdated the model and animation so that the head stays attached to the body\nThe dummy now reacts to all damage types\nCan be killed with /kill command, by withers and by void damage.\nDps number now appears on the status bar. You can choose between static and dynamic dps in the config.\nAdded configs to change a few aesthetic things\nEquipping and unequipping functions alot more like an armor stand\nBase is a bit smaller and centered on the block grid\nCustom armor models from other mods render properly (only 1.16 for now)\nSwinging animation is not much smoother\nAct as scarecrows when equipped with a pumpkin\nFixed some bugs\n","published":"2022-11-13T02:03:58.377412Z","updated":"2024-05-05T22:44:37.872800Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":268132,"followers":236,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":["decoration","game-mechanics"],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["qo2XMMhP","XYByr7D5","La9N7Ttu","zCPdDOOP","gEbry6GM","lTTirNtq","NKpNuhkD","zFPaMFa0","yMmYJ5I3","HPj6DZ24","S6QNPOFv","2ykUPWwJ","PcKbqBY4","Jt0fxF3M","ZganhQm7","hGI5KQLh","mQfY3H0A","rY6H6hgv","UvxYYzDm","EI0ydz1r","9nNuKVUq","ydAkQ5P1","TFlgTQCK","owOKOJTn","AAiySuI2","UxWhycwZ","OktgetPL","4IxqrWac","aD0lXWYG","Wsi8MeIx","evFX9Ei5","WovXXEkH","VEQbqZhv","EwVfOzqs","xzyrFq6U","oejSEBjB","7MCqqDqj","8gDpcYEM","GClsjyQs","zQNItGls","fkn90qf0","G6J2yYte","sQU1xRdi","qhumF2VU","QOOGkq3O","VFmZdzCp","xVBLDt8m","FxnUacjh","s1thtpLn","rbotmafd","dGifKxWx"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Adega8YN/f5e7ffbd18426c584bd43b59770fb2965d420c9f.png"},"version":{"id":"rbotmafd","project_id":"Adega8YN","author_id":"BU21lLGA","featured":false,"name":"1.20-1.8.17b","version_number":"1.20-1.8.17b","changelog":"no

Phantom Loader allows you to automatically generate Forge and Fabric initializer classes on build time by keeping all code, or most of the code, in the common module.\n\nThe Phantom Library also takes care of abstracting each mod loader's basic functionalities to allow the developer to only depend on the abstraction from the common module.\n\n# For developers\n\nDocumentation for setting up and using **Phantom Loader** can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/PhantomLoader/PhantomLoader/wiki).\n\nAn example mod using **Phantom Loader** can be found [here](https://github.com/PhantomLoader/ExampleMod).\n\n# Credits\n\nAuthor: [HexagonNico](https://modrinth.com/user/HexagonNico)\n","published":"2024-01-08T20:55:21.406591Z","updated":"2024-01-21T16:29:59.059130Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":85888,"followers":4,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["sWhP3ogE","o8ozyiiQ","annjd0zf","Cdh02cwK","9u8gBHR9","s1vUE6kk","aAEdUquE","FFgX70q1","OHyJ7PO0","B9fXEIOv","vkAgziWj","oQcz6PNL"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/mWdDy9A0/ceb21e8d4f6391c968dcb42b01a82eb700d119ba.png"},"version":{"id":"vkAgziWj","project_id":"mWdDy9A0","author_id":"6PSF6Asp","featured":false,"name":"Phantom Library - 20.1.5 Fabric","version_number":"20.1.5","changelog":"# Version 20.1.5\n\n* Fixed crash on dedicated server caused by Forge client events being fired on the server\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-21T16:29:50.770047Z","downloads":8524,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"84405f8899fd5b212fd2ebb34724b22ff4aa698c0797ceb95a38455755965851763b18c13f1ba87e92126e314b38fe907324442037c53c2ccfdbe4dc734f3b98","sha1":"0aec33e4a393f124059a99fe476755bd3657e258"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/mWdDy9A0/versions/vkAgziWj/library-fabric-20.1.5.jar","filename":"library-fabric-20.1.5.jar","primary":true,"size":106044,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"gRXwS7Hj","user":{"id":"6PSF6Asp","username":"HexagonNico","name":"Nico","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51746628?v=4","bio":"This is a Bio.\nYou're welcome.","created":"2021-11-17T06:54:12.150994Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"library-fabric-20.1.5.jar"},"mods\\ctov-friends-and-foes-compat-2.0.jar":{"sha512":"43a5373b0f94b13fee6872a74cacdd51aa47b1d62b9212a7af4360bf47b66aa2f8165753aa2c344884a20287203c3b98b9b8f3afab2708fca0ebcb687308f4c8","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"kawJN2LZ","slug":"ctov-friends-and-foes-compat","project_type":"mod","team":"HqNcLzvx","title":"CTOV - Friends and Foes Compat","description":"Compatibility add-on for Friends and Foes mod and CTOV","body":"Add this datapack to the game to add compatibility between CTOV and Friends and Foes.

","body":"Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\nMouse Tweaks is purely client-side. There is no server-side component.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n","published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.895120Z","updated":"2024-05-12T16:27:48.472824Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1817774,"followers":1784,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","modloader","neoforge"],"versions":["RNWLd5dh","VmXwwpoa","ZP9EDGxB","7F7mEY80","Q3YILuAe","EGSuwm1J","q0CGibTg","ILp7UQip","475fj6e8","NanXuqPE","pmMCbsN3","Un7oJEL8","kyT0ersE","Aax1dmTi","5EvmIoqj","dXBVA16v","sjDYaHEo","stb5nE30","m0Dd8Cjy","jBovYAZR","LABx1dmK","mjuG4AYd","LG14xw1O","7nm8NrSL","1n3YehcE","nWbxhour","7JVXOe3K"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"mjuG4AYd","project_id":"aC3cM3Vq","author_id":"On32SQVu","featured":false,"name":"[1.20–1.20.4 Fabric] Mouse Tweaks 2.26","version_number":"1.20-2.26-fabric","changelog":"- Improved compatibility with slots with custom stack limits (like in the Nether Chested mod).","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-02T16:59:36.217330Z","downloads":203991,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"6a6b977e671b1ab625e740fc70fb5300c21bb841","sha512":"d0faf200dda358efddad2d2809f646023f4dd06254572369e07f3bf33cb6941f0fcdb02db4675b30b4f3bd542cbf6196e135680ba91a2b74c2b071f34978e2d5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/mjuG4AYd/MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.26.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.26.jar","primary":true,"size":77943,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"92e908a8ac714509904a6b484a24c68a43569a28a4a2800d9ea1144c8de9476363707e40c7eb3739712a0c94312b244f014f8114ca83b668b55a4b7164f56abf","sha1":"42f757f20c9437f93aa9aa912519231db91e961c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/mjuG4AYd/MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.26-sources.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.26-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":65765,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Gn6mAc1d","user":{"id":"On32SQVu","username":"YaLTeR","name":"Ivan Molodetskikh","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794388?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-03-20T15:35:29.504966Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.26.jar"},"mods\\modelfix-1.15-fabric.jar":{"sha512":"8724fe22274465f38129f81babb97b7fff68e89b0c88e22a2acbd801ddbeb0210864c2774377fe7b69b917db5889677c1b0d67084f4847cab0f7bd3203e187d4","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"QdG47OkI","slug":"modelfix","project_type":"mod","team":"Nq0CQj6q","title":"Model Gap Fix","description":"Fixes gaps in Block Models and Item Models","body":"Model Gap FIX\n\n \n\nThis is a simple client mod that fixes https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-73186\n\nwhich affects both Block Models and Item Models and possibly other models too\n\n \n\nThe mod works by removing texture zooming, making every model face use 100% of its texture, unlike of what it did previoulsly.\n\nThisnot only fixes this bugs on items (where it's most noticeable) but with block models too and everything else that might use those functions.\n\n \n\nThis issue was especially noticeable with custom block models or some 2d items.\n\n \n\n \n\nQ&A:\n\n- Will this slow down my game? \n\nNot at all! Removing texture zooming just removes some code and has no impact. If you however want to be nit picky the mod also slightly tweaks item models in a way that could add a ouple more quads for concave item textures compared to vanilla so in that case it could very slightly worse that vanilla. This is however negligible and could only be an issue when trying to run high resolution packs\n\n- How does this work?\n\nThe base fix is simply removing texture zooming. This is extremly simple to do and immediately \"fixes up\" all those problematic gaps on models.\nFor 2d item models something else is needed as this alone creates another kind of tiny gaps in them due to the way they are generated, quad by quad. These are very tiny and they flicker so I had to fix those too. To do so I've changed the item model generator to never create a quad that encompasses a transparent pixel and instead create multiple quads for each row of solid pixel in the same direction. This allows me to slightly increase the size of all these side quads without creating new gaps in the process, thus covering all gaps seamlessly. Note that this last part only applies to forge as fabric does not seem to have such tiny lines and the models work right away with no extra quad\n\n ","published":"2022-09-13T21:58:16.905418Z","updated":"2024-03-21T17:21:40.224008Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2089401,"followers":1206,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["aZZZrtpR","vJ00juj2","7ainrOrH","EglYgeMq","Kfbnfh5q","i0mERlxq","ZvRvG9JE","r6uVoUxU","fbaUxdx3","BEeRgTMS","kST7zzvZ","GkLb4bRl","og4A1nN8"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QdG47OkI/5a8203e120985d11616614e11ad7b888997000d8.png"},"version":{"id":"GkLb4bRl","project_id":"QdG47OkI","author_id":"BU21lLGA","featured":false,"name":"1.15","version_number":"1.15","changelog":"changed default configs to have quad expansion off\nYou can turn it back on yourself if you want in the configs","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-21T17:21:32.822860Z","downloads":148654,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"75554b02e63a2440321a32dc5e55988897181bdf","sha512":"8724fe22274465f38129f81babb97b7fff68e89b0c88e22a2acbd801ddbeb0210864c2774377fe7b69b917db5889677c1b0d67084f4847cab0f7bd3203e187d4"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QdG47OkI/versions/GkLb4bRl/modelfix-1.15-fabric.jar","filename":"modelfix-1.15-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":65491,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Nq0CQj6q","user":{"id":"BU21lLGA","username":"MehVahdJukaar","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24719182?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-21T07:42:29.648721Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"modelfix-1.15-fabric.jar"},"mods\\completeconfig-2.5.2.jar":{"sha512":"51adb91a25524aed916d431203f4e3bc0bfbca5842ae31f352eeffb552487602af64a26e8bcee1ff71e9f114ad71e0afc0d593785741b674b3ec7f8121b657da","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"GtqG8z1h","slug":"completeconfig","project_type":"mod","team":"p65E1P3Q","title":"CompleteConfig","description":"Configuration Library for Fabric Mods","body":"CompleteConfig is a configuration library for Fabric mods.

gaps in their way.**\n\n - The mobs that currently have the jumping ability are Zombies, Zombie\n   Villagers, Zombified Piglins, Silverfish, Endermites, Endermen,\n   Wither Skeletons, Skeletons, Spiders, Cave Spiders, Illagers,\n   Witches, Iron Golems, and Creepers.\n   \n - The AI attempts to be realistic to vanilla jumping, which means that\n  slow mobs can't jump very far. (Zombies can only jump one block for\n  example).\n\n## Limitations\nThe ai does not do additional pathfinding, so it can't calculate a complicated series of jumps. Also, the ai starts to fail under very fast mob speeds or high jumps.\n\n## Configuration\nThe config file uses JSON. Add a mob by listing its id, and a priority. You can find mob ids by using the /summon command - the list of arguments will be a list of mob ids. The priority is a bit jenky. It represents what priority the AI has over other AIs. A lower value means that the jumping AI probably won't be overridden, but it might override other AI's. Unfortunately, the most certain way to gauge this is to look at the entity source code, but setting a low priority should in most cases be totally fine.\n\n## Installation\nThis is a regular [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/install) mod, except that [Fabric Kotlin](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-language-kotlin) is required.  \nDependencies that need to be in the mod folder:\n\n-   [Fabric Kotlin](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-language-kotlin)\n-   [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)\n","published":"2021-01-26T02:52:18.859577Z","updated":"2023-12-21T20:01:25.562781Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":51382,"followers":99,"categories":[],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["bEMaiOTx","E7hsRLGO","ws9rTWHC","dw4g51oB","40sT1JPD","5hm10noi","6CxMFXxG","ddGsksMj"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Lh7ROUhC/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"ddGsksMj","project_id":"Lh7ROUhC","author_id":"4mbpRYUJ","featured":false,"name":"Mobs Attempt Parkour 0.5.2-1.20","version_number":"0.5.2-1.20","changelog":"Fix crash with loader 0.15.0","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-21T20:01:26.482371Z","downloads":47438,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"beb622dfdaeb66584a2c91f70cd6eba8798f9ef4beefefa5dbe4a60118dff0154550d0cf4b25727755c646a5a5b7dd26645c08216c48e6deb615084f6ce5c8ce","sha1":"5639ac66889c79ae8b558c93d9db8661e9611a09"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Lh7ROUhC/versions/ddGsksMj/mobs-attempt-parkour-0.5.2-1.20.jar","filename":"mobs-attempt-parkour-0.5.2-1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":156525,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Ha28R6CL","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"YP1Wty8C","user":{"id":"4mbpRYUJ","username":"Barribob","name":"Michael Yoshimura","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/32251924?v=4","bio":"","created":"2020-11-06T00:22:37.692642Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"mobs-attempt-parkour-0.5.2-1.20.jar"},"mods\\comforts-fabric-6.3.5+1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"68fe9aa7dfb23c0f0dd377a2430f4e7a7213dd280a1aec98ab336b4d87dc9eef48a81798e34d7e76b88f377bfb7c0a9200f4f4b8b1d978ddf217a0fd0594bcb0","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"SaCpeal4","slug":"comforts","project_type":"mod","team":"k4xx1DQB","title":"Comforts","description":"Adds sleeping bags and hammocks for, respectively, portability and turning day to night, without setting new spawns.

The difference is\nthat sleeping bags can be stacked and are more convenient to use on adventures and hammocks are like\nan inverse bed, turning day to night.\n\n## Features\n\n### Sleeping Bag\nThe recipe for the sleeping bag is simply three pieces of matching color wool in a straight line.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/LCNV0HS/sleepingbagrecipe.gif)\n\nYou can also dye a regular White Sleeping Bag into any of the other colors!\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/R24frvM/sleepingbagrecipe2.gif)\n\n### Hammock\nThe recipe for the hammock cloth is simply a piece of colored wool in the center, sticks to the top\nand bottom, and the rest of the slots are strings.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/nQZH5Ld/hammockrecipe.gif)\n\nYou can also dye a regular White Hammock Cloth into any of the other colors!\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/Jd5JcWf/hammockrecipe2.gif)\n\n**Please refer to [this](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Comforts/wiki/Hammocks#building) guide for\ninstructions on how to build the hammock.**\n\n**Configuration Options**\n\n- Auto-Use Sleeping Bag\n- Well-Rested Mechanic\n- Sleepiness Factor\n- Hammocks at Night\n- Sleeping Bag Break Chance\n- Sleeping Bag Debuffs\n- Insulated Sleeping Bags\n\n## Affiliates\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.ibb.co/1G4QPdc/bh-illusive.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/illusive)","published":"2023-02-03T00:12:22.007446Z","updated":"2024-06-04T07:08:49.989230Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":860104,"followers":639,"categories":["adventure","decoration"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["dHrSKL4J","c1r3IQ5i","aGuoSKwG","ArfJfNNQ","hQP0wrCY","ZyTxtFj8","IOKMgz2A","s5LKEIOP","67l2afHb","Ct4mFCUB","3QAM0nJh","de4Ew1fk","ywEwzvxB","U7z1UGEs","2TuGHiZI","DFNEJtPk","BZLqo5mz","CeY7jdWr","ctG2XnT3","NtVX4qbd","UdZSGyFh","xb4TiGPS","paJzntZf","1XmpwUAS","eny6SErU","ErWeNcks","ODTvTTsy","2R48PHme","tSzzMaGY","mRqCYEl9","9nh6jEqR","j7LyiMPf","GBZRiZpX","opkwrwqb","931lwegu","HdRgbiAf","35QTsWN6","FRk7TuF3","MFDqF6YP","ePAcflcJ","XIeDGnhd","Ef7a2lsY","TJTAQTxQ","FYC20xkF","XARWuNYu","3nNu4JfG","45xmlJpV","4gN165vy","Np0ASroj","Fsk1gLtM","jNc4BcHk","4xI610Ck","kFg7vTI1","RDL041db","EitEWOXA","hIVk1aXV","D2F8i5te","KgzjTw3n","Ga1xieMT","dgUU0OQZ","N8auIkK2","eERpuRc2","b447UIZg","7xyPjpyG","9sRsDjzm","1FZ3WFZm","DdseSSi9","OzDgRdin","rJbqJOyx","9qOe1XXv","eXcBRSHm","PjwVQUB4","IuKA4kB7","3krX2BL3","VrL4d7zl","vUdakIzK","CZFrqdSy"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/SaCpeal4/ed4840f0c9a30e04ad88413bd82cd762dd6ec95d.png"},"version":{"id":"D2F8i5te","project_id":"SaCpeal4","author_id":"zbpHS3ry","featured":false,"name":"comforts-fabric-6.3.5+1.20.1","version_number":"6.3.5+1.20.1","changelog":"The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).\n\nThis is a copy of the changelog for the most recent version.

Originally it was a part of [Pufferfish's Skills](https://modrinth.com/mod/skills) mod, but was split and now can be used independently.\n\n## Attributes\n\nSome attributes work different from vanilla ones. Instead of providing a value they modify dynamic values using addition or multiplication. For example damage dealt by attacking using various weapons. They work like normal attributes, but their base value is internally set to the dynamic value. Changing base value of these attributes is not possible, because it is permanently set to [NaN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN). These attributes are marked as dynamic in their description below.\n\n- Stamina\n- Melee Damage\n- Ranged damage\n- Fortune\n- Healing\n- Jump\n- Resistance\n- Mining Speed\n- Sprinting Speed\n- Knockback\n\n### Stamina\n\nAttribute `puffish_attributes:player.stamina` allows to change hard coded stamina value, which is 4 by default. Stamina determines how much exhaustion player must collect to decrease food/saturation points.\n\n### Melee Damage\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.melee_damage` modifies damage dealt using melee weapons.\n\n### Ranged damage\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.ranged_damage` modifies damage dealt using ranged weapons.\n\n### Fortune\n\nDynamic attribute  `puffish_attributes:player.fortune` modifies fortune when mining a block, also applies without having fortune enchant on the item.\n\n### Healing\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.healing` modifies how much health is restored by natural regeneration.\n\n### Jump\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.jump` modifies how high player can jump.\n\n### Resistance\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.resistance` modifies resistance of the player\n\n### Mining Speed\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.mining_speed` modifies mining speed of the player.\n\n### Sprinting Speed\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.sprinting_speed` modifies sprinting speed of the player.\n\n### Knockback\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.knockback` modifies knockback power of the player.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nThis mod supports both Forge and Fabric. It may conflict with other mods that add similar attributes. Please report an issue if you find an incompatibility.\n\n**It is incompatibility with every version below 0.12.0 of Pufferfish's Skills, because that versions includes everything that Pufferfish's Attributes adds. However, version 0.12.0 of Pufferfish's Skills, when released, will no longer contain Pufferfish's Attributes, therefore these mods will be compatible.**\n\n## Versions\n\nVersions that are maintained and will receive future updates are: 1.18.2, 1.19.2, 1.19.4, 1.20, 1.20.2, 1.20.4.\n\n## Modpacks\n\nYou can use this mod in your modpack as long as you do not redistribute this mod.","published":"2024-03-28T19:41:07.521172Z","updated":"2024-06-02T17:23:01.276929Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":10319,"followers":15,"categories":["game-mechanics","library","utility"],"additional_categories":["management"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["vjyrgZ4t","aEXrd6Gk","akYwrf2x","OwpspM8j","q1YNYX46","HtTHEvn5","2jVaBWQQ","KiBBrgIr","aowYX1Ng","w8DsSlyJ","kLlwnjhn","OMRHNS0p","eOzlYeYS","jZ6clufT","2mtm3wlX","7ZCWortj","1RMeTDan","RYphekww","TouzHJRA","89goX9JR","Zs11lNLI","mRqyVmZg","Hv1gf4f7","FWcjGg1K","tgtUFpm3","LfFhx9Iy","fQadECPH","uIfUdSKo","i8zbWbtl","AeGH5WvW","BeCYfSDL"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/FCFcFw09/f25e0000aca9f043997af84f44d33099f7c6b8ef.png"},"version":{"id":"q1YNYX46","project_id":"FCFcFw09","author_id":"3fJOgX88","featured":false,"name":"Pufferfish's Attributes 0.1.0","version_number":"0.1.0","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-25T14:10:18.805428Z","downloads":3640,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"704c67092120094144b02338a345d5416005e06d","sha512":"3c97d04dbdedbeb2cff76c1389877b1501bfebe0d48513427049d19a64c3f6b6bb724d3ad8471032d54fd446efbd9cbc42e6b97907039df65a495a995f68a4fa"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/FCFcFw09/versions/q1YNYX46/puffish_attributes-0.1.0-1.20-fabric.jar","filename":"puffish_attributes-0.1.0-1.20-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":22218,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"L04V2Tpb","user":{"id":"3fJOgX88","username":"Pufferfish","name":"pufferfish","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82769502?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-05-28T22:28:22.642802Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":{"id":"LfFhx9Iy","project_id":"FCFcFw09","author_id":"3fJOgX88","featured":false,"name":"Pufferfish's Attributes 0.3.0","version_number":"0.3.0","changelog":"- Improved compatibility.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-02T17:22:03.996997Z","downloads":777,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"60fc1dd3c1acba01d7576af1411be6c7094ad85380d78ed0fd5f2d86fdec69c4b8d85fe90593c8a1e9cfd6038cf8131a150ec6b94e77faac27722060f2b301eb","sha1":"2f661ffc04fb0d4944a6c8245a831115ef7fe831"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/FCFcFw09/versions/LfFhx9Iy/puffish_attributes-0.3.0-1.20-fabric.jar","filename":"puffish_attributes-0.3.0-1.20-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":22635,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"incompatible":true},"file_name":"puffish_attributes-0.1.0-1.20-fabric.jar"},"mods\\alloy-forgery-2.1.2+1.20.jar":{"sha512":"8900553bd4498af1c3e6ee3994b986e58149986bd1ad3233cddba06559cce73ae8ff47bceb125f1dab31d73be66014be67e02af86408b3872f32370574233b50","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"jhl28YkY","slug":"alloy-forgery","project_type":"mod","team":"JaVz7Wl9","title":"Alloy Forgery","description":"Forge some alloys","body":"<center><img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/449b11a149923f6d9e38aa0ec16f2e35160b8df9.png\" /></center>\n\nAlloy Forgery adds a multiblock alloy smelter, the **Alloy Forge**.

no peeking for resources or player bases!\n- Totally server-optional - installing AA (or just [surveyor](https://modrinth.com/mod/surveyor)) on the server enables structures and sharing.\n- Structures only appear on the map after you've stood in or looked at them in-game:\n\n![structure discovery](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Y5Ve4Ui4/images/86054c7949fed59341cef60d0d9f27aee86ae6ef.gif)\n\n- Markers for waypoints come in a variety of styles:\n\n![marker styles](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Y5Ve4Ui4/images/f22a29ce8a00847e5a49d74d4c32f7b076a57692.png)\n\n- Markers are automatically added for notable structures, player graves, and active nether portals:\n\n![structure markers](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Y5Ve4Ui4/images/190cc4eaa2e8784dd0f46bee9c225228a05f191a.png)\n\n- Map exploration can be shared with `/surveyor share [player]`, also revealing their position on the map:\n\n![map sharing](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Y5Ve4Ui4/images/4422049c395a856c35bbc361c52e8bcd30e89523.png)\n\n- All of the above is data-driven using resource packs.\n\n#### Stylized Design\n\nAntique Atlas is designed to feel like your own explorer's memory, or a permanent journal.</br>\n\n- You can only see what you've seen before.\n- You can't \"lose\" your map in any way.\n- Flavour text is written subjectively:\n\n![grave style euphemisms](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Y5Ve4Ui4/images/c6f5e20bcef2c26c40390e888e540dcdd89a1818.png)\n\n#### Don't Play the Map\n\nAntique Atlas is designed to keep your focus on your surroundings, not the map.\n\n- The best view of the world is in-game - not the atlas!\n- The atlas stays on its own easily-accessible screen, no distracting minimap.\n- If you're always using your map as a compass, try [PicoHUD](https://modrinth.com/mod/picohud) as well.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\nAntique Atlas can be configured from `config/antique-atlas.toml`<br/>\n\n`fullscreen` can be disabled to lock the size of the map screen based on your GUI scale.<br/>\n`mapScale` can be adjusted to change the effective GUI scale of the tiles on the map.<br/>\n`structureMarkers` can be edited to toggle markers for structures - this is automatically populated from the respack.<br/>\n`graveStyle` will change the icon and tooltip for player graves - try each out to suit your pack's aesthetics.<br/>\n\n### Resource Packs\n\n> For more information, check out the [resource pack tutorial](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/wiki/Resource-Packs).\n\nBy default, Antique Atlas will use biome tags to approximate a builtin texture for any modded biomes.\n\nTo improve this, add `namespace/atlas/biome/path.json` with `{ \"parent\": \"minecraft:biome\" }` or [custom texturing](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/blob/1.20/src/main/resources/assets/minecraft/atlas/biome/badlands.json).\n\nStructures can be similarly [tiled](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/blob/1.20/src/main/resources/assets/minecraft/atlas/structure/piece/jigsaw/single/pillager_outpost/watchtower.json) or [marked](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/blob/1.20/src/main/resources/assets/minecraft/atlas/structure/type/ocean_monument.json) - provided you're familiar with each type of structure identifier.\n\nTile textures are loaded from `textures/atlas/tile` and use an _autotile_-like format.<br/>\nYou can also add an [mcmeta file](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/blob/1.20/src/main/resources/assets/antique_atlas/textures/atlas/tile/structure/fortress/nether/nether_fortress_bridge_crossing.png.mcmeta) to adjust which other textures should \"connect\" and vice-versa.\n\n#### Markers\n\nMarker textures are loaded from `textures/atlas/marker` and are 32x32 by default.<br/>\nYou can similarly add an [mcmceta file](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/blob/1.20/src/main/resources/assets/antique_atlas/textures/atlas/marker/structure/end_city.png.mcmeta) to adjust size, offsets, and any custom mip levels.<br/>\nTo add a player-placeable marker, put the texture in the `custom/` subfolder.\n\nTo automatically mark a non-structure point of interest, use Surveyor's Landmark API - Like in [Surveystones](https://modrinth.com/mod/surveystones).\n\nTextures for landmark types will be used automatically when named `namespace/textures/atlas/marker/landmark/type/path.png`. \n\n---\n\n### Version History\n\nThis is a loveletter rewrite - we want to revitalize interest in antique atlas, and make it easier for others to maintain and add to.\n\n`0.x` uses arch, keeps the original `antiqueatlas` ID, and should be save/network/API-compatible with [tyra's port](https://modrinth.com/mod/antique-atlas), sans the atlas item.\n\n`1.x` uses fabric, and is API-incompatible with 0.x.\n\n`2.x` uses fabric and [Surveyor](https://modrinth.com/mod/surveyor) - and is save, API, network, and respack-incompatible with older versions.<br/>\nWhen upgrading to 2.x, map exploration and markers will be cleared - downgrade and take notes if needed!<br/>\n\n---\n\n### Afterword\n\nAll mods are built on the work of many others.\n\nThe art for antique atlas was created by [Hunternif](https://github.com/Hunternif) ([DA](https://www.deviantart.com/hunternif)) and [lumiscosity](https://github.com/lumiscosity) ([Neocities](https://lumiscosity.neocities.org/)).<br/>\n[Click here](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/blob/1.20/credits.txt) for detailed art credit.\n\nThis mod is a fourth-gen rewrite, and relies heavily on contributions of many developers and artists before us.<br/>\nWe can't draw autotile to save our lives - feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atexturing)!\n\nThis mod is included in [Tinkerer's Quilt Plus](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt) - our modpack about rediscovering vanilla.\n\nWe're open to suggestions for how to implement stuff better - if you see something wonky and have an idea - let us know.\n\n---\n\n<center>\n<b>Tinkerer's:</b> <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt\">Quilt</a> -

Simply put, *dying in Minecraft is annoying!* Keeping your inventory on death is great when the event was unintentional or unfair. However, it can be easily abused: what's stopping players from careening off a cliff so they can get back to base more easily?\n\nCalibrated Access provides systems accessible to the early-game that, for example, could be used to \"bank\" items on-the-fly to prevent item loss in case disaster strikes. Concerned about balance? See the *Balance* section in the details below!\n\n## Details\n\n### Balance\n\nThe first tier of remote, the Novice Accessor, is simple to craft. Indeed, its recipe is designed for the early game. However, the lower tiers of Accessor are quite limited in their functionality. The most effective factor for balance is the number of **accesses** a specific remote has.\n\nUpon using a calibrated remote, one access point is consumed. Players can only use a remote if it has at least one access point left. The only way to replenish the access counter is to **recalibrate** with another block. A Novice Accessor has three accesses; this amount is small enough that players will have to stop and think about whether they want to use the remote at a time. A Skilled Accessor has seven accesses; an Expert Accessor has fifteen; an Unlimited Accessor does not have an access counter.\n\nThere is also a 15-second **grace period** that begins when a remote is used. During this period, players can freely open and close the remote without losing another access point. Additionally, the remote will have a \"zap\" effect on its antenna while the grace period is active. However, an Unlimited Accessor's zap is merely visual.\n\nAnother balancing factor is the **interdimensional capability** of an Accessor. Only the Novice Accessor is unable to open blocks' screens from other dimensions. The second tier of remote, the Skilled Accessor, requires Quartz to craft, requiring players to first venture into a different dimension before they have that extra level of safety.\n\nA final property is the number of remotes that can be used at once. This defaults to just one, though you can change this with a game rule described in the *Additional Features* section below. Go ahead and try to game the system; this is implemented with a \"sessions\" system that maps each calibration instance to a UUID. As a side-effect, this makes all calibrated Accessors **per-player**.\n\n### Additional Features\n\n- Four new advancements in the *Adventure* tab\n- An API to add custom behavior when accessing specific blocks.\n  - [See the wiki for a brief overview](https://github.com/acikek/calibrated-access/wiki/Custom-Access-Behavior)\n- `maxRemoteSessions` game rule to control the number of Accessors that a player can have calibrated at once\n- `allowSyncedIdMismatch` game rule to control whether a remote can try to access a different block type at the same position it was calibrated to\n\n## License\n\nMIT © 2023 spadeteam","published":"2023-01-25T23:36:10.961571Z","updated":"2024-03-12T05:23:39.699202Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":9576,"followers":40,"categories":["adventure","game-mechanics","storage"],"additional_categories":["equipment","technology","utility"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["ZAdHtiPP","WiFDX4Rs","d8lcP6oH","ig1mpTtu","O5J32GjT","LcrSRXhJ","17rbP0f5","wXhNcy8L","7A5KpuYw","DHbxdT6b","xYOShFcz","Oj0nE6A5","RozWujR4","r16lUWi9","pZzGZgrX","9an4xg11","wtm7d282"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/pUSRRdVF/eb359db7c3979084aa7a1887725cf0d02460dc09.gif"},"version":{"id":"wtm7d282","project_id":"pUSRRdVF","author_id":"rtyJqzhz","featured":true,"name":"1.3.1","version_number":"1.3.1-beta.1+1.20","changelog":"- Fixed a bug with NBT serialization","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-12T05:23:40.536304Z","downloads":2247,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"7e60ddef2acd8b7488e88113a46d41f9a031acf7","sha512":"d3166fcc5a83624692483f8c1a73454b8aa7f2859ab7ad00e18df92a7e30d5fc34f68d44844230452b180ab839e9c543e6ebd87a0456fe61d6946348d5d2b7e1"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/pUSRRdVF/versions/wtm7d282/calibrated-1.3.1-beta.11.20.jar","filename":"calibrated-1.3.1-beta.11.20.jar","primary":true,"size":348502,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"bbvSY1VI","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"embedded"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"t5W7Jfwy","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"oPUqHh5n","user":{"id":"RJDuxV9o","username":"Trudle_","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/RJDuxV9o/d3a878ed4c020812e3211a3d7db8d6eb9a454140.png","bio":"hi","created":"2023-02-09T19:54:25.697927Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"calibrated-1.3.1-beta.11.20.jar"},"mods\\Towns-and-Towers-1.12-Fabric+Forge.jar":{"sha512":"ed734046c356bb996b628c2e0c47e64ba598c87016591fd77533069de68f27b8bfdcd2173d7d3db97f1981ebb806133c3d1751c330d539ade3d6c37ed2d5598f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"DjLobEOy","slug":"towns-and-towers","project_type":"mod","team":"PfKGoCzl","title":"Towns and Towers","description":"Spice up your world with new villages, pillager outposts, and even new ships!","body":"<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><font color=\"#FFE16A\" size=\"3\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic\">\n<center><strong style=\"font-weight: 400\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AS OF RIGHT NOW, TOWNS \nAND TOWERS IS AVAILABLE FOR BOTH FORGE AND FABRIC/QUILT, VERSIONS 1.18.2 AND 1.19.2 RESPECTIVELY.

The structures themselves are a bit \nmore detailed than their vanilla counterparts, but they still fit seamlessly \ninto the world. Not only that but many are inspired by real-life buildings or \narchitectural styles, giving them a fresh new feel. There are over 50 structures \nadded by Towns and Towers so far (as of update 1.9), so have fun exploring! And \nremember, it’s not the destination that’s important, but the journey to get \nthere.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color=\"#FFE16A\">If you wish to see all \nof the structures our mod adds, take a look at our gallery </font>\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/CCZbqMn\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</h3>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><u>Compatibility</u></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a full list of mods \nthat are currently compatible with Towns and towers, please look\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gE5DvsPwztTtCVi_i6nEOLQM6tm8NU4Q1iCpuqHY2UM/edit\">\nhere</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pack should be \ncompatible with most world generation mods, like Terralith, WWOO, BYG, BoP, \netc., as well as mods that add also add new structures/villages, such as \nRepurposed Structures or ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Villages. However, some \nfeatures from other mods are not currently present, like the guards from \nVillager Guards mod or certain buildings from Farmer's Delight for example. This \nwill be addressed in the future via a series of datapacks, which will implement \nfeatures from those mods into ours.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 align=\"center\"><strong><u>Frequently Asked Questions</u></strong></h2>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>1. Is it safe to update Towns and \nTowers to a newer version?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general yes. Just \nnote that sometimes when we update a few things get changed, so there might be a \nbit of console spam. If any serious problems arise because of that, let us know. \nAnd, as always, make backups. Better be safe than sorry.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>2. Is it safe to add \nTowns and Towers to an already existing world?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yep. Just note that the \nnew structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>3. Is this mod for \nForge or Fabric/Quilt?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both. We have a \nuniversal version for both (now three?) mod loaders.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>4. How can I locate the new \nstructures?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 1.18.2: /locate \ntowns_and_towers:[structure_from_list]<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 1.19+: /locate structure \ntowns_and_towers:[structure_from_list]<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that some structures have the exclusives tag added \nin front. Those structures cannot be located if you only have T&amp;T installed. You \nalso need to have one of the mods that T&amp;T is paired with. For a full list, \nscroll down below (if I remember to add it...).<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>5. Does Towns and Towers modify \nexisting vanilla structures?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of the latest \nupdate, no. Only new structures are added.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>6. What about the \nloot of these structures?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of \nstructures use vanilla loot tables for better mod compatibility (see the \nCompatibility section below for more info), but they also use some custom loot \ntables to better integrate said structures into the world. You will still find \npillager outpost loot in pillager outposts, profession chests in villages, as \nwell as bells, workstations, etc., but also new stuff like food, armor, and \nother goodies.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>7. How can I report \nbugs/issues/suggestions?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write them down below \nin the comments and I’ll try to answer them as soon as possible and as best as \npossible. I’m still relatively new to all of this, so excuse that.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>8.

This is required for Simply Skills to generate files. (Not needed for 1.20+ versions)**\n\n### **Features**\n\nSimply Skills provides a combat oriented skill tree for Fabric, complete with unique passive skills, specialisations, and signature abilities.\n\nDriven by a vision to enrich combat encounters within Minecraft, Simply Skills harnesses the power of the  [Spell Engine](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/spell-engine)  &  [Spell Power Attributes](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/spell-power)  framework (created by Daedelus). By adopting this framework, players are empowered with distinctive skill sets that enable them to stand out among their peers and fully immerse themselves in the class fantasy they desire.\n\n#### **- Passive Skills -**\n\nUnlike the typical stat increase nodes on the tree, Passive Skills provide you with unique passive abilities that alter game mechanics in unique and meaningful ways.\n\n#### **- Specialisations -**\n\nSpecialisations can be unlocked by working your way through the base skill tree, until you reach a specialisation path. Once a specialisation path has been chosen, you will unlock an additional seperate skill tree that contains abilities and skills unique to your chosen specialisation. You may only have one specialisation unlocked at a time.\n\n#### **- Signature Abilities -**\n\nSignature Abilities, unlocked by advancing to a specialisation path, provide you with unique active abilities that can help to turn the tide of battle. These abilities can often be further enhanced and customised via passive nodes in the relevant specialisation skill tree. Due to their power, these abilities have an internal cooldown. (default keybind 'V')\n\n#### **- Respecialisation -**\n\nYour base skill tree can be reset by using a Malevolent Manuscript. This will refund all points spent in the tree.  \nIf you have a specialisation unlocked at the time of use, this will also erase all points spent within the specialisation tree. The points lost will be gone forever, so choose carefully.\n\n### **Roadmap**\nSubject to change\n\nQ4 2023: Ascendancy Tree\n- Additional late-game player progression\n\nQ1 2024: Additional Specialisations\n- Necromancer & Shaman\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWant to play with Simply Skills on a server with friends?

game logic/server optimization mod","body":"Lithium is a modern, general-purpose optimization mod for Minecraft which works to improve a number of systems (game physics, mob AI, block ticking, etc) with the goal of **not changing any vanilla mechanics**. \n\n<br>\n\nThe mod works **on both the client and server**, and can be installed on servers **without requiring clients to also have the mod** (and vice versa.)\n\n<br>\n\nFor multiplayer servers, administrators can expect a sizeable improvement to tick times, allowing their hardware to support more loaded entities, chunks, and players. Even in single-player, Lithium helps to improve performance by optimizing the internal game server, which is used for \"ticking\" the world. This can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and increased responsiveness**. \n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe strict goal of maintaining exact behavior with vanilla makes Lithium suitable for almost any Minecraft server running Fabric, even for highly complex gameplay scenarios and creations. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla gameplay has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile you're at it, you may want to check out two of my other mods, [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), as they're both fully compatible and only help to further improve performance in different parts of the game.\n\n<br>\n\n## Configuration\n\nLithium makes use of an semi-unusual configuration system which allows you to enable or completely disable patches the mod applies. This system allows fine-grained control over what code in Minecraft is modified by Lithium, and as such, can be used to completely eliminate bugs or mod incompatibilities introduced by the mod.\n\n<br>\n\nFor more information, please read [the wiki entry](https://github.com/jellysquid3/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on modifying your configuration file.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease note: An empty configuration file is *perfectly normal* and just means you want to use the default options, which are already set up out of the box for the best performance the mod can offer.\n\n<br>\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.\n\n","published":"2021-01-03T00:56:52.292581Z","updated":"2024-04-29T20:44:11.845709Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":6734676,"followers":9421,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["EhG1mQzx","5fmGl08Y","ouTdXXWj","igqdFUYG","pGhOMdTm","Le0tKjFX","rvsW1zhb","7jxErppe","aZ0JFf08","cTZv31gu","nVR7Q63z","FHFKMKeu","2w527DB2","2CbyxeU0","2aoHIXuK","Ehsd7YUl","MoF1cn6g","pHl1Vi6k","pXdccFQf","sIKhU9s4","ZRR9yqHD","Zs3sdHjK","Nba2vozh","2ysRxhIL","ySBrfN8N","xVm1caOt","IQxlSIiw","FXG2XqRP","ALnv7Npy","OKrb9xMn","3Gq9H7R9","7scJ9RTg","XS6vJwop","sMWkk4VU","GYl3zwgt","m6sVgAi6","53cwYYb1","14hWYkog","2KMrj5c1","ZSNsJrPI","qdzL5Hkg","WzQmxYRa","nMhjKWVE","tDFVQpHO","bAbb09VF"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"ZSNsJrPI","project_id":"gvQqBUqZ","author_id":"uhPSqlnd","featured":false,"name":"Lithium

Not only can you finally give them something to hold in survival mode, you can also freely configure all body parts to pose armor stands as you please. And that's not all! There is a set of built-in poses to choose from, a settings panel for various properties of armor stands, and also great tools for positioning the armor stand, even in ways where you can use it to only display items. And best of all: This mod works on servers without it! You'll need operator rights though. And when the mod is installed on both client and server, all players can use it freely without any permission requirement. Also a few additional features will become accessible.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BDxblqV.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">To use the handy new screen added by Armor Statues, you'll have to shift + right-click an armor stand placed in the world. This will open the last screen you were using. Switch to different screens using the tabs to the left. Quickly switch between those tabs by pressing the <code>Tab</code> key.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/55/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The <strong>Rotations Screen</strong> allows you to freely move around head, body, both arms and both legs. Rotation values are restricted to a certain range to prevent weird rotations. To unlock this restriction, simply click the lock icon to move sliders on the full range of 360 degrees. When moving the sliders with your cursor isn't precise enough, try clicking a slider first, then use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move it around with greater accuracy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The screen also offers buttons for reseting the current pose, for creating a random pose, and also two buttons for copying the current pose and pasting it elsewhere. You can only copy one pose at a time.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/56/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The next screen is the <strong>Poses Screen</strong>. Here you are offered a selection of bult-in poses to choose from. After selecting a pose you can also go back to the rotations screen to customize that pose. Built-in poses are the same as found on Bedrock Edition, so you might already be familir with them.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/57/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The <strong>Style Screen</strong> gives access to some of the basic armor stand options. You can also set a name, which will show above the armor stand, directly in the gui, so you don't have to use a name tag. The <i>Sealed</i> option is only available to creative mode players.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/58/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The <strong>Position Screen</strong> allows you to place the armor stand with great precision, you can also change the rotation. To be able to better see how you're rotating/moving the armor stand around, click the magnifying glass button to hide most screen elements and give you a clear view. When moving the armor stand around a lot it probably is a good idea to disable its gravity on the style screen.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/60/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The <strong>Alignments Screen</strong> is directly taken from the <a href=\"https://vanillatweaks.net/\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>VanillaTweaks</strong></span></a> <i>Armor Statues</i> data pack. Here you can position an item or block held by the armor stand, and also hide the armor stand, so the item/block appears only by itself.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/61/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Finally the <strong>Equipment Screen</strong> gives you access to the armor stands equipment slots via a menu. This screen only shows up when Armor Statues is installed both client- and server-side.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BDxblqV.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/55/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/56/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Change rotations of every single body part</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Choose a built-in pose, or set it as a base for your own</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/57/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/58/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Set some settings, and select a name</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Move your statue to an ideal spot with great precision</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/59/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/60/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Enter focus mode to better see what you're actually doing</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Use armor stands to place items in the world</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/61/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Set new equipment directly in the screen</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BDxblqV.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I cannot edit armor stands on my vanilla server!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Make sure you have operator right on the server you are trying to edit armor stands on. When not present on the server, Armor Statues sends vanilla commands to the server to change armor stand values.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Mods can have three different kinds of configs depending on the kind of settings they provide: <strong>Client</strong>, <strong>Common</strong>, and <strong>Server</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Client</strong> and <strong>Common</strong> configs are found in <code>/.minecraft/config/</code>, named as <code>&lt;modId&gt;-client.toml</code> and <code>&lt;modId&gt;-common.toml</code>, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Server</strong> configs though are applied per world, therefore you'll find those in <code>/.minecraft/saves/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for local singeplayer worlds, and in <code>/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for you Minecraft server. Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for

open-source, and community-driven translations for ALL Minecraft mods.","body":"# _Loqui's development is paused until I have the time and resources to properly maintain this project._\n\n### **_Loqui depends on community contributions, please help us translate at [Loqui's Translation Project](https://loqui.imb11.dev/)_**\n\n[![](https://github.com/IMB11/Loqui/raw/master/lokalise_badge.png)](https://lokalise.com/solutions/for-managers)\n\n# Loqui\n\nThe goal of Loqui is to provide free, open-source, and community-driven translations for ALL Minecraft mods.\n\n*A NeoForge port is planned, but the current goal is to smooth out any significant bugs and issues that may happen.*\n\n## For Users\n\nSimply drop Loqui into your mods folder, and it will download any translations you need from the Loqui API, it's that simple!\n\n## For Modpack Developers\n\nAgain, include Loqui in your modpack and you can allow your users to play in their native language!\n\nIt's recommended you encourage your community to join the [Translation Project](https://loqui.imb11.dev/) in order to improve the quality and quantity of translations - the more the merrier!\n\n## For Mod Developers\n\nA system is currently being developed that will allow mod developers to download translations from the Loqui API and bundle them directly into their mods.\n\nLoqui has an intelligent algorithm that allows translations to be accurate across versions, and ignore any existing translations your mod may provide!\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **Crowdsourced translations** - Get your mod translated by the community for free, all translations are moderated by verified proofreaders.\n- **Automatic updates** - No need to manually update translations, Loqui will do it for you.\n- **Ability to download translations** - You can download the translations from Crowdin and bundle them directly in your mod if you wish.\n\n## Technical Explanation\n\n- Loqui traverses your mods folder, gathering information on mods and what `en_us.json` files are present.\n- It then sends this information to the Loqui API, which returns any translations that are available, and indexes any new unrecognized `en_us.json` files it recieves so that the community can translate them.\n- Loqui then downloads these translations and places them in the correct location.\n\nFor more information, visit the [Loqui Website](https://loqui.imb11.dev/).\n\n## Opt-out\n\nOpting out can be useful if:\n\n- You already provide crowd-sourced translations.\n- You have a custom translation system.\n- You don't want your mod to be translated.\n\nIf you wish to opt-out of Loqui, you can do so by adding a `noloqui.txt` file to your mod's resources directory.\n\nEg: `assets/namespace/noloqui.txt` would disable loqui for any language files within the `namespace` namespace.\n\nIf you wish to have your mod removed from Loqui entirely - including any `en_us.json` files that have been pre-indexed, please contact me directly.\n","published":"2024-04-09T16:54:06.341758Z","updated":"2024-04-22T20:14:52.875171Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":51394,"followers":44,"categories":["game-mechanics","utility"],"additional_categories":["library"],"game_versions":["1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["e6k73r7u","rOcGnAeK"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cMpxLYTx/abcef8e3bff8f11b063c83eae9951867e4fa3ee8.png"},"version":{"id":"rOcGnAeK","project_id":"cMpxLYTx","author_id":"bOHH0P9Z","featured":true,"name":"Loqui

DNS lookup for pure IP server addresses\n\nExtracted from the `yeetServerIpReversedDnsLookup` option in [TweakerMore](https://modrinth.com/mod/tweakermore) Mod\n\n### What & Why & How\n\nFor servers whose addresses are represented solely by IP, e.g. `192.168.2.10:25565`, disable reverse DNS lookups in the corresponding `InetAddress` object\n\nMany non-loopback IPs lack associated domain names, which makes reverse lookups time-consuming\n\n```java\n// java.net.InetAddress.getHostName(boolean)\nString getHostName(boolean check) {\n    if (holder().getHostName() == null) {  // It will be null if InetAddress.getByName() received a pure IP \n        holder().hostName = InetAddress.getHostFromNameService(this, check);  // <-- takes forever\n    }\n    return holder().getHostName();\n}\n```\n\nThis option sets the domain of those servers directly to their IP, bypassing the reverse DNS check\n\nThis results in a 1s ~ 5s reduction in time for servers with

Its features are tailored to be functional, aesthetically viable, and complementary to preexisting content and provide many new ways to enhance your Vanilla+ experience.\n> The mod requires Moonlight Library<br>\n> While supported, Fabric version might be missing some minor features as the mod is mainly for Forge<br>\n> You are free to include this mod in your modpack\n\nTranslated in the following languages!\nDeutsch | Polski | Fran&ccedil;ais | Русский | Italiano | English | Če&scaron;tina | 한국어 | Українська | Portugu&ecirc;s | Српски | Espa&ntilde;ol | Қазақ | Bahasa Melayu | Pirate Speech | 简体中文 (中国) | 繁體中文 (香港) | 繁體中文 (台灣) | T&uuml;rk&ccedil;e</span></p>\n\n<center>\n<h2> 🖼️ Media 🖼️ </h2>\n</center>\nCheck out some reviews here\n<br>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/avG7OTcsJA0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vHQSjNacrm4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<center>\n<h2>❓ F. A. Q. ❓</h2>\n</center>\n\nQ: How do I disable/tweak X feature?\nA: Refer to the Customization section in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/Supplementaries/wiki) or join our [Discord]()\n\nQ: Could you update/downgrade to X version?\nA: I plan to eventually port the mod to every new major Minecraft version so be patient.\nAs for downgrades absolutely no, I'm not interested in supporting older obsolete versions. Maintaining this one version already takes up so much of my time and so much changed between those versions that I would have to pretty much re-learn how to mod.\n\nQ: Could you add X feature/block?\nA: I would encourage you to join our Discord. We have a section dedicated to suggestions like that. If I'll feel like your idea fits well enough it will have a high chance to be eventually added.\n\nQ: How do I use X block/item?\nA: Once again refer to the Wiki.\n\nQ: How can I fix this issue/ crash?\nA: Please open a report in the Issues section always including a Crash Report.\n\nQ: Fabric version is missing X\nA: Supplementaries is a mainly a Forge Mod and if some feature is missing that means that it didnt have a simple or easy implementation as Fabric was missing a counterpart of something provided by Forge API that such feature was heavily reliant on.

Specifically, it makes the initialization of DataFixerUpper \"lazy\" - that is, it will not immediately create the rules required to migrate data from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions until it actually needs to do so.\n\n**This mod is for Fabric/Quilt**\n\n## Compatibility\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.2 is compatible with Minecraft 1.14 through 1.18.2, and works on the client and server side.\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.3 is compatible with Minecraft 1.19 and above, however Mojang now implements the functionality LazyDFU provides on the server side. The client still initializes all DFU rules by default, so LazyDFU hooks into the native client functionality that enables DFU rule baking and turns it into a no-op.\n\n**As of Minecraft 1.19.4 and above, however, Mojang has significantly optimized DFU initialization enough that this mod is no longer necessary in many configurations. It will continue to be supported for older versions of Minecraft.**\n\n## Sponsor me!\n\nDid this mod make Minecraft playable for you? [Chip in a bit of money](https://github.com/sponsors/astei) so I can continue developing it.\n\n## Why does it work?\n\nDataFixerUpper (often abbreviated to DFU) is the Minecraft component responsible for handling world upgrades from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions. DFU is initialized very early in the Minecraft startup process - in fact, it's initialized before the game window even appears. It is laughably overengineered and very slow, but it's what Mojang gives us to work with.\n\nAs part of the DFU initialization process, it caches rules required to convert from older versions to MInecraft through every version in between, up to the version of the game being launched. This process takes place in the background, but it is _extremely_ slow, as it is both CPU and memory intensive. With Minecraft 1.16.5, I have measured this process take 9 seconds on a Ryzen 9 3900X desktop (a high-end desktop CPU released in 2019) and 57 seconds on a laptop with an i5-8250U (a mid-range laptop chip from 2017).\n\nAll LazyDFU does is stop this process - it lets DFU initialize, but it will force it to not cache all these rules. As a result, the DFU rules are only compiled when a world needs to be converted. This means it is possible you may see lag spikes if LazyDFU forces the game to compile migration rules, but once complete there is no performance penalty.\n\n## Prove it to me\n\nI [recorded a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXDqJ598kKA) that shows you how effective LazyDFU is.\n\n## Comparing it to other mods\n\nIn comparison to other mods, LazyDFU has the primary advantage of being _simple_, _safe_, and having _low impact_ on the game.\n\n* LazyDFU is a very simple mod. The entire mod is about a dozen lines of code, about as uncomplicated as a mod can get, while still delivering huge benefits. (This means it's also an ideal mod to use to experiment with a new Mixin platform!)\n* LazyDFU is highly compatible and safe. LazyDFU is extremely unlikely to conflict with other mods. This mod is based on a similar patch in [Paper](https://papermc.io) that had been in use for over a year with no reported issues with migrating to newer versions of Minecraft. (Paper has since changed to replacing Mojang's data fixers with a highly optimized implementation of its own.)","published":"2021-01-04T05:14:07.259717Z","updated":"2022-06-08T01:13:18.555078Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":3207281,"followers":3592,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["8tFjDrHf","aBDhdWUD","C6e265zK","4SHylIO9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/hvFnDODi/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"4SHylIO9","project_id":"hvFnDODi","author_id":"y0WF9UR5","featured":false,"name":"0.1.3","version_number":"0.1.3","changelog":"* Update to Minecraft 1.19\n* Mojang now (by default) does not build datafixer rules on servers.

Any picked up or equipped item is dropped back on the ground when the entity despawns to make sure you don't lose your items incase the mob picks them up after your death.\n<br>\n<br>\nYou can still prevent mobs from naturally despawning by naming them with a name tag.\n<br>\n<br>\nAdded a config : <h2><code>config/letmedespawn.json</code></h2>\n\n```\n/lmd reload\n```\nTo reload the config

General Notes\n\n* CraftPresence identifies as a **Client Side-only** mod\n    * This means it **will not run** on the Server's side.\n    * Fabric and Quilt mod loaders will simply ignore the\n      mod, while other mod loaders may crash.\n* Some versions of CraftPresence for Minecraft 1.14.x and above require\n  the [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)\n  and the [Fabric mod loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer)\n* Versions of CraftPresence for Minecraft 1.1.0 and below\n  require [Risugami's ModLoader](https://mcarchive.net/mods/modloader)\n\n## Features\n\nIn addition to having the ability to change your discord status from \"Playing Minecraft\",\nThis mod offers plenty of customization options to specify entirely how others see you play.\nFrom having your current biome show up, to which dimension your in, as well as which server you're in, and more.\nThe customization possibilities are limitless, with the only real limit being how creative you customize your display.\n\n### Launcher and Pack Integration Support\n\nCraftPresence will detect whether your Launch Directory contains:\n\n* A ATLauncher Instance (instance.json)\n* A valid Twitch/Overwolf/Curse/GDLauncher Manifest (manifest.json, minecraftinstance.json)\n* A MCUpdater Instance (instance.json)\n* A Modrinth Instance (profile.json)\n* A MultiMC Instance (instance.cfg)\n* A Technic installedPacks File (installedPacks)\n\nIf using any of these launchers, note the following:\n\n* Prior to v1.6.0, it'll put the packs name in your display as well as show its icon (when not in a\n  server)\n* From v1.6.0 until v2.0.0, it'll instead parse the Pack's name into the `&PACK&` placeholder, that you can configure\n  for\n  usage in the RPC\n* In v2.0, the pack's info is instead parsed into the `pack.name` and `pack.icon` placeholders, that you can configure\n  for\n  usage in the RPC\n\nAs an example, this is how the mod will convert a pack's name to an iconKey:\n\nExample: `All the Mods 7` would parse as `allthemods7`\n\nNote: MultiMC natively has an Icon Key Property that is used instead of converting from the Pack's Display Name\n\n## Commands\n\nCraftPresence currently offers the following Commands:\n\nKeep in mind the following:\n\n* Commands must be prefixed by either `/craftpresence` or `/cp`\n* In v1.5.0 and above, these commands are only usable via the Commands Gui, found within the Config Gui\n\n___\n\n* `/cp compile \"[expr]\"` - Test the output of a placeholder expression, via Starscript\n* `/cp search (type:typeName, [searchTerm], all)` - Search for valid placeholders available to use with Rich Presence\n* `/cp reload` - Reloads mod data\n* `/cp request` - View Join Request Info\n* `/cp export` - View export commands for mod data\n* `/cp view` - Help command to display the commands available to view and control a variety of display data\n    * `/cp view placeholders` - Displays all available placeholders for use in the RPC\n    * `/cp view currentData` - Displays your Current RPC Data, in text form\n    * `/cp view assets (custom | all)` - Displays all asset icon keys available to you\n    * `/cp view dimensions` - Displays all Dimension Names available for use, requires `Show Current Dimension` to be\n      enabled\n    * `/cp view biomes` - Displays all Biome Names available for use, requires `Show Current Biome` to be enabled\n    * `/cp view servers` - Displays all Server Addresses available for use, requires `Show Game State` to be enabled\n    * `/cp view screens` - Displays

display the above commands and these explanations\n\n## KeyBinds\n\nCraftPresence currently contains the following KeyBinds:\n\nNotes:\n\n* In v1.5.5 up to v1.8.0, KeyBinds are now customized in the Accessibility Settings in the Config Gui, and not the\n  normal controls menu\n* In v1.8.0 and above, KeyBinds can now be customized in either the dedicated menu in the Config Gui or the normal\n  control menu on applicable versions\n\n___\n\n* `Open Config Gui` - KeyBind to open the CraftPresence Config Gui (Default: GRAVE/TILDE Key)\n\n## About Placeholders and Functions\n\nIn some configuration areas, CraftPresence provides some placeholders and functions to make things easier:\n\nKeep in mind the following:\n\n* In v2.0.0, placeholders have been rewritten to be compatible\n  with [Starscript](https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/starscript)\n    * The older list of this section can be\n      viewed [here](https://gitlab.com/CDAGaming/CraftPresence/-/wikis/Legacy-Placeholders-(v1.x))\n    * All Placeholders, functions, and code expressions must be surrounded with curly brackets (Example: `{foo.bar}`)\n    * In the event that you need to combine a placeholder with other data in a function argument, use the `getResult`\n      function\n    * Additional functions and standard variables are available\n      within [StandardLib](https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/starscript/wiki)\n\n___\n\n### Placeholder List\n\nThe following placeholders are available for use anywhere in

can hinder certain portions of the backend in addition to cause certain parts of the mod to not work.\n\nWith this in mind, please note the following:\n\n* **Minecraft 1.16 and above**\n    * As more parts of the game become data-driven, modded data is no longer able to be automatically retrieved without\n      first being in the world.\n    * So far, Biome and Dimension Modules are effected by this change and only display default data, with extra data\n      needing to be discovered first.\n* **Minecraft 1.15 and below**\n    * `MC-112292`: When interacting with the `RenderUtils#drawItemStack` method, used in the v2 Item Renderer, blocks\n      using certain renderers may fail to display properly.\n    * Additionally, on 1.15.x exclusively, z-level issues may occur on Screens using this method\n* **Minecraft a1.1.2_01 and below**\n    * On these versions, the Biome and Dimension Modules are **stubbed** with default data, due to the logic for these\n      methods being missing (Having been initially implemented in Alpha 1.2.6)\n* **Miscellaneous Issues**\n    * Due to obfuscation issues in earlier versions of Minecraft, the Biome and Dimension Modules may fail to\n      auto-detect some necessary information.\n        * As a fallback, the mod is also designed to add selectable Module Data when said biome/dimension is first\n          discovered.\n        * The \"Add New\" option found in some of the module lists can also be used to work around this issue.\n\nAdditionally, in select Minecraft Versions, the following config settings are effected:\n\n* `guiBackgroundColor` (`RenderUtils#DEFAULT_GUI_BACKGROUND`)\n    * MC 1.6 and above: `minecraft:textures/gui/options_background.png`\n    * MC 1.5.2 until a1.1.2_01: `/gui/background.png`\n    * MC a1.1.2_01 and below: `/dirt.png`\n* `stripTranslationColors` (`ModUtils#IS_TEXT_COLORS_BLOCKED`)\n    * This option is forcefully disabled on MC 1.1.0 and below due to various issues regarding TextColor usage,\n      including possible crashes\n    * This change is also auto-applied to existing configs trying to bypass this, unlike the background colors, since\n      resource packs can re-implement those textures\n\n### Icon Requesting\n\nNot seeing an Icon you like or have a suggestion for an Icon to add/modify on the default Client ID?\n\nIf so, you can make a request on my [Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.com/CDAGaming/CraftPresence/issues/), with the\nfollowing requirements:\n\n* If adding an Icon from a dimension, specify the Mod's link that the dimension derives from\n    * This is because specific Icon IDs must be used, which can be found by the mod or from checking your Logs/Chat\n      after entering the dimension as CraftPresence will tell you the ID expected\n* An Icon of size between `512x512` and `1024x1024` to be used (Either minimum or recommended size for best quality)\n    * Icons between these sizes can be used, but may not give a great final quality\n* If requesting an icon to be modified or removed from the Default Client ID, please specify a reason why\n    * Mostly just so it can be logged why it was changed for future reference\n\nAdditionally, you can also create your own Set of Icons by\nfollowing [this guide](https://gitlab.com/CDAGaming/CraftPresence/-/wikis/Making-your-Own-Client-ID-+-Using-your-own-Images)\n\n### Support\n\nNeed some assistance with one of my mods or wish to provide

v2.3.9 (1.20.1)","version_number":"2.3.9+1.20.1","changelog":"# CraftPresence Changes\n\n## v2.3.9 (04/25/2024)\n\n_A Detailed Changelog from the last release is\navailable [here](https://gitlab.com/CDAGaming/CraftPresence/-/compare/release%2Fv2.3.8...release%2Fv2.3.9)_\n\nSee the Mod Description or [README](https://gitlab.com/CDAGaming/CraftPresence) for more info regarding the mod.\n\n### Changes\n\n* (Backend) Updated Build Dependencies (Please see the appropriate repositories for changes)\n    * Fabric Loader (`0.15.9` -> `0.15.10`)\n    * Unimined (`1.2.0-SNAPSHOT` -> `1.2.3`)\n    * ClassGraph (`4.8.170` -> `4.8.172`)\n    * DiscordIPC (`0.8.6` -> `0.8.7`)\n    * UniCore (`1.0.9` -> `1.0.10`)\n    * SpotBugs (`4.8.3` -> `4.8.4`)\n    * ModPublisher (`2.0.5` -> `2.1.1`)\n* Quality of Life UI Improvements\n    * A new `Display Settings` UI has been added to the Main Config GUI, to decouple the Display-Specific options from\n      the `Presence Settings` screen (`Dynamic Icons`, `Dynamic Variables`)\n    * The `Presence Settings` UI has been renamed to `Presence Editor` and has received several layout updates for a\n      cleaner look as well as `Reset` support\n    * Removed `Sync Config` support for sub-categories due to recently discovered tech limitations\n    * `Accessibility Settings` has received layout improvements as well as adjustments for MC 1.20.5 changes\n\n### Fixes\n\n* Fixed Issues relating to `Reset` and `Sync` config operations in the `ConfigurationGui`\n    * `Reset` now properly adjusts the `Instance` data instead of the `Current` data, fixing early changes in\n      sub-categories\n    * `Sync` now also adjusts the `Instance` data instead of just the `Current` data, fixing false save indicators\n* Resolved an issue where `markAsChanged()` was being triggered early in `Presence Settings`\n* Fixed a missing tooltip for the `Presence Settings` button in the `DynamicEditorGui`\n* Fixed a possible `NullPointerException` that could occur in the `ColorEditorGui`\n    * Occurs if the `DEFAULTS` field is `null`\n    * The appropriate buttons will now be disabled if these are `null`\n* Fixed config data loss related to `ColorEditorGui` and `DisplaySettingsGui` changes\n    * This is the same issue that occurred with the `DynamicEditorGui` in v2.3.8\n\n___\n\n### More Information\n\n#### Known Issues\n\nDespite configuration compatibility being ensured between v1.8.x/v1.9.x and v2.0,\ncaution is advised to ensure the best experience, while also baring in mind that features can be adjusted, removed, or\nadded/iterated upon between releases.\n\nThe following known issues are present in this build:\n\n* The HypherionMC Config Layer (To Convert a Simple RPC config to CraftPresence) contains the following known issues:\n    * Placeholders related to the realm event are currently unimplemented and parse as `{''}`.\n\nPlease refer to the Mod Description or [README](https://gitlab.com/CDAGaming/CraftPresence) to view more info relating\nto known issues.\n\n#### Snapshot Build Info\n\nSome Versions of this Mod are for Minecraft Snapshots or Experimental

<strong>Naturalist</strong> adds more animals to the game that behave as they do in real life. There is a working food chain, sleep cycle, and tons of other fun behaviors, giving each animal a personality of its own.

It's a hard life for a fish!</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Ducks</strong>&nbsp;waddle around the Swamps, their feet slapping across the ground. They hold many secrets!</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Dragonflies</strong>&nbsp;love buzzing around the Swamps! I found a note in a mineshaft that said they liked Chorus Fruit. I wonder what that's about?</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Lizards</strong>&nbsp;are the recluse of the Swamps and don't like people, but they're very loyal if fed their favorite food!</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Tortoises</strong>&nbsp;mosey around the Swamp in search of their next meal. They're famous for their hard shells!</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>🌳 Woodland Wildlife Update</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Forested and Grassy Biomes are now inhabited by <strong>Bears</strong>, <strong>Birds</strong>, <strong>Butterflies</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Caterpillars</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Deer</strong>, <strong>Fireflies</strong>, <strong>Snails</strong>, and <strong>Snakes</strong>!</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Bears</strong> are the gentle predators of the forest. Don't provoke them or go&nbsp;near their cubs and you'll be fine... unless you're a Deer.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Birds</strong> fly around the treetops, chirping as they do so. Maybe they'll be&nbsp;loyal to you in return for food.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Butterflies</strong> flutter about, looking for flowers (and crops) to pollinate.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Caterpillars</strong> spawn by breeding butterflies and will crawl around, looking for nearby trees to create a chrysalis on.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Deer</strong> walk and run across the world, munching grass and avoiding Bears.&nbsp;I wonder if there's a way to mimic their movement?</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Fireflies</strong> light up the night and can be found in biomes such as Forests,&nbsp;Plains, and Swamps. Would it be weird if you consumed one?</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Snails</strong> crawl around the forest floor... aimlessly. As Snails do. Be careful&nbsp;you don't jump on them, or they might meet an unkindly fate.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Snakes</strong> are lower forest predators, consuming the smaller animals&nbsp;that Bears can't be bothered to hunt.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">🦁 <strong>Deserted Drylands Update</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Dry biomes such as Savannas and Deserts are now inhabited by <strong>8 new animals</strong>; <strong>Lions</strong>, <strong>Giraffes</strong>, <strong>Elephants</strong>, <strong>Hippos</strong>, <strong>Rhinos</strong>, <strong>Vultures</strong>, <strong>Zebras</strong>, and <strong>Boars</strong>!</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Lions</strong> are the rulers of the Savanna, and will hunt mobs at night. Be careful though, they won&rsquo;t hesitate to fight back!</span></li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Giraffes</strong> are gentle giants. If you feed them a Golden Apple, they&rsquo;ll allow you to ride them for 30 seconds. During this time, Maps&rsquo; radius are greatly increased. To breed them, use a Hay Bale!</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Elephants</strong> mosey around, minding their own business. They fight back when attacked.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hippos</strong> tend to stay near the water, but watch out, because they&rsquo;re <em>always</em> hungry! They&rsquo;ll attack boats and any Players that go into their pool. To breed them, feed them a Glistering Melon or a Melon Block while they&rsquo;re in the water.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Rhinos</strong> are generally docile unless they have a baby with them. If aggro&rsquo;d, or if their baby is approached, they will scrape their foot 4-5 times before <em><strong>charging!</strong></em></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Vultures</strong> fly around, squawking in the air. Come nightfall, they&rsquo;ll attack <strong>Zombies.</strong> When Players are low on health, Vultures will swoop down, stealing the item in the Player&rsquo;s hand. If a Vulture steals an item, they&rsquo;ll carry it around while flying. If Rotten Flesh is dropped on the ground, they&rsquo;ll trade out the item they&rsquo;re holding.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Zebras</strong> are the Savanna&rsquo;s equivalent of Horses, and are tameable in a similar way. They&rsquo;re a slippery bunch though, and will run away if approached! However, once tamed, they run faster than Horses while in water, and can be chested.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Boars</strong> are neutral animals that replace Pigs in Savanna biomes. When attacked, they will fight back, and run away when low on health. I wonder what happens if they&rsquo;re struck by lightning..</span></li>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">For more detailed information about each mob, click <a href=\"https://starfish-studios.com/mods/naturalist\">here</a> to read our official wiki.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong><b>⚠️</b> Frequently Asked Questions&nbsp;<b>⚠️</b></strong></span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p><strong>Q : Can I use this mod in my modpack or make videos about it?</strong><br />A : Yes!

It contains the following options :\n* `spreadFactor` : the factor by which the separation and spacing of structures should be multiplied. The default value is `2`, which means that structures will be twice as rare. If you want structures to be more common, you can set this value to `0.5` for example.\n  * ⚠️ **Warning** : a very low value (like `0.01`) makes the world generation process considerably slower.\n* `customSpreadFactors` : a list of custom spread factors for specific structures. The default value makes the mansion twice as rare as an example (which has no effects with a global `spreadFactor` of 2). If you want to change the spread factor of a structure, you can add an entry to this list. Each entry is a JSON object with two fields : `name` (the name of the structure) and `spreadFactor` (the spread factor of the structure). Here's an example :\n```json5\n{\n    \"name\": \"minecraft:mansion\",\n    \"spreadFactor\": 2\n}\n// More detailed info can be found inside the config file\n```\nFor now (v2.0), you have to restart the game for the config to be reloaded.

About:\nPanda's Falling Trees makes every tree fall like trees from [Dynamic trees](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamictrees), while still maintaining the original trees from Vanilla Minecraft.\n\nThe mod should support other mods if log and leaves blocks are a part of the log and leaves Block Tag\n\n## Showcase:\n![](https://github.com/PandaDap2006/Pandas-Falling-Trees/blob/master/assets_for_readme/showcase_falling_tree_large.gif?raw=true)\n\n## FAQ:\n- [Q] Is the mod safe to use on worlds originally made without the mod. \n  - [A] Yes the mod is 100% safe to use on worlds originally made without the mod.\n- [Q] Will the mod work for more than 1 block thick trees. \n  - [A] Yes the mod works for trees that are more than 1 block thick.\n\nIf you have any of your own questions, please leave them [here](https://github.com/PandaDap2006/Pandas-Falling-Trees/discussions/categories/q-a).\n\nYou can also join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/wjPt4vEfXb)\n\n## Known Incompatibilities:\n- **Optifine:** I cant promise that compatibility will ever be possible.\n- **Wilder Wilds:** Game crash when mining trees. I recommend blacklisting the logs and leaves in the mod config.\n- **Physics mod:** I will not make compatibility because it's not open sourced, if compatibility should ever be a thing, then the creators of the Physics mod should add it.\n\n---\n### Do you need a cheap Minecraft server and want to support me, click the banner below and sign up, you can also use my code to get 15% off you first month at Kinetic Hosting.\n[![](https://github.com/PandaDap2006/PandaDap2006/blob/main/assets_for_readme/kinetic_hosting_banner.png?raw=true)](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=476)","published":"2023-06-25T12:47:34.041434Z","updated":"2024-05-23T19:31:41.898179Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":196988,"followers":306,"categories":["game-mechanics"],"additional_categories":["utility"],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["WtDsFjzh","n92y5meB","5ckc8NzU","NYEUnukc","xn2kV197","CJGfmmAs","9su4u7T0","JLM1Fi2p","wChqKomP","QOwqfPTU","u1gU8ac3","E9s9rBGB","GoZsrIV5","uIVvZLYT","89s78sTK","IF0kLiJJ","7xDQbGrA","YbcZPHxp","lnewxGBB","uqBA4fE8","c4QtQfol","G53Qu3ap","b2jQX3Ie","g2qlhANi","vSLjfELU","l5AjLLBg","gfsCiAgB","up73458W","daTI5X0l","olaqnQG5","wvior7Dr","bBpkGdjw","BZRjHtYY","w233N9om","G3wnsOjf","K6A6QfKW","huUDMPJ6","o26Sc7Jw","lPWpo0am","MdZg6CLH","sWGNzQDT","4fdi9Afc","EWXAuaAD","3zFSBccO","JnOtis6U","1BfQ8hn8","NAOPX5Pl","jnzhGop5","JrUd4NpU","NvBB1Emt","AuMeKq5o","4bI3n49q","32EfDffD","LRdBCtvl","gMONewv1","wzLjhwv5","u1yRZF7P","sW1aVE2R","SoIjMcCy"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/i2kUe4lq/88ba36f4d1ebf0206919d524d248fe65d6ee37d8.png"},"version":{"id":"sW1aVE2R","project_id":"i2kUe4lq","author_id":"eQudRSDI","featured":false,"name":"Panda's Falling Tree's 0.12.1","version_number":"0.12.1","changelog":"## Version 0.12.1 Changelog\n#### Fixes:\n* Fixed Mining speed not changing to default when crouching\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-23T19:31:08.710785Z","downloads":5135,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"fc059f1b40e1aef40aabec89ab0c365655ac97e7","sha512":"16515d03cbbbbfc18866dde37fe8d76ca7ef96a10f2a18457c154d09b629a1146320aa1b2fecae86b83b57f4884b06861ef82946e76d7c74678b4ad49485071f"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/i2kUe4lq/versions/sW1aVE2R/fallingtrees-0.12.1-fabric-1.20.jar","filename":"fallingtrees-0.12.1-fabric-1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":4005467,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mEEGbEIu","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"lhGA9TYQ","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"SyMXh8Q5","user":{"id":"eQudRSDI","username":"PandaDap2006","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/eQudRSDI/870222e35121a423c379a71e8945e270529c6bd4.png","bio":null,"created":"2023-04-24T19:48:14.438269Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"fallingtrees-0.12.1-fabric-1.20.jar"},"mods\\moonlight-1.20-2.11.22-fabric.jar":{"sha512":"29228df429d26eb0881e515b41fbe14d4e2c9e80ff59223f9a3ed759c8b762a867cee2e0973fcb95f555a661932331accb916a0d943fb90b680b2d5955fc3ce6","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"twkfQtEc","slug":"moonlight","project_type":"mod","team":"Se0LRYS8","title":"Moonlight Lib","description":"dynamic data pack and registration, villager activities, custom map marker and a lot more","body":"Features of this library are:\n\n- Dynamic resource pack utilities\nA set of utilities that allow creating dynamic runtime resource packs and datapacks. Also easily allows respriting and retexturing existing textures, specifically useful to add new wood based blocks.\n\n \n\n- Dynamic block set registration\nAllows mods to specify a block set (which can be for example a wood type). The mod then will scan all registered blocks and fill the block set up only to then allow mods to register blocks that depend on it.\n\nThis can't be easily done using traditional methods since the wood set itself depends on the registered blocks so registration must happen at a very specific time. This utility makes that task possible and easy to do. Note that it is still a form of dynamic registration which might have some drawbacks.\n\nIn a nutshell you have dynamic wood type support for your blocks. The wood set type already comes built-in.\n\n \n- Custom map markers: \nA complete system that allows to easily implement and add map decoration and map markers as well as control every aspect of them like rendering. Also allows storing simple data inside maps data offering a couple of hooks to use it too like on item tooltip.\nThis system also offers a simple Data Driven implementation meaning you can easily register new markers with datapacks!\n \n\n- Dynamic Villager AI\nA helper system to easily and dynamically add tasks and modify villager schedules in a compatible way without overriding the whole existing AI. Also allows to properly add memory types\n\n \n\n- Custom first and third person animations:\nAllows modders to implement a simple interface in their items to allow it to have custom third and first person animations (like crossbows). \nIncludes simple and easy to use interfaces that can let you control first person and third person animations as well as a callback for rendering the item itself (similar to spyglass) directly in your item class\n\n \n- Grindstone achievement triggers:\nThe mod adds a custom trigger that gets called when an item is passed through a grindstone that you can call in your mods advancements jsons\n\n\n- Soft fluid system:\nAn entirely Data Driven custom virtual fluid system that goes on top of forge one and is designed to fit better in vanilla minecraft and having as main feature the ability to have multiple fluid containers items like bottles, bowls and buckets, as well as providing support for stews and drinks that can be consumed directly from a fluid tank. As opposed to the forge fluid system it has a base unit of 1 minecraft bottle (250 forge mb). The system also automatically generates all the needed fluids for already registered forge fluids and allows the user to override them or add to them easily.

For example a bucket of water will normally convert into an empty bucket when used as a crafting ingredient however newer buckets such as the bucket of powdered snow will be completely consumed. With this mod installed all affected vanilla buckets will convert into an empty bucket as expected.\n\n## Affected Buckets\n- Bucket of Pufferfish\n- Bucket of Salmon\n- Bucket of Cod\n- Bucket of Tropical Fish\n- Bucket of Axolotl\n- Powder Snow Bucket\n- Bucket of Tadpole\n\n## FaQ\n\n### How does this work with servers?\nWhen this mod is installed on a server the bug will be fixed for all connecting players while on the server even if they do not have the mod installed. If the mod is only installed on the client the bug will only be fixed for single player worlds. It is recommended that client and server install the mod for consistency. \n\n### Will this fix buckets added by mods?\nNo. The issue fixed by this mod only impacts vanilla buckets. If a bucket added by a mod has this issue the author of that mod is responsible for fixing their own bucket code and you should report the issue to them.

With the help of a piston, the Ram block can damage and break blocks, much like a goat ramming into a tree.\n\nBreak speed depends on the hardness of the block. Additionally it will be able to break anything up to obsidian hardness but only iron tier blocks will drop\n\nDoes not work with enchantments as it's a block\n\nAlso inflicts knockback and damage on entities when pushed\n\n### Barbaric Helmet\n\nThe Berserker Helmet is a life-saving piece of equipment crafted from goat horns and copper. It provides the player with strength and speed on lower health.\n\n### Chevon\n\nChevon is a new meat dropped from goats.\n\n### The Geep\n\nGeeps are the result of breeding a goat with a sheep. they cannot breed themselves, but does yield wool and chevon, and can be milked.\n\nAlso they are more frail with less health and cannot be dyed\n\n### Thatch\n\nDecorative building block perfect for your nordic builds!\n\n<center>\n\n## ⚙️ Mod Integration ⚙️\n</center>\n\n> If Windswept is installed, Chevon meat will be disabled in favor of its ones\n> Chevon can be used in some Farmers Delight recipes\n\n*Make sure you have enough ram!*\n\n*Credits to Ariboa12 for the barbaric helmet idea*\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2024-05-01T06:08:18.836384Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":5789320,"followers":5175,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9","agJm6Vrw","PPnbi6JY","HWBrlwWv","i9RcCdZv"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"unerR5MN","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"6.0.1 (Fabric/Quilt)","version_number":"6.0.1","changelog":"- Fix performance issue in quad deduplication in some corner cases\n- Slightly improve memory usage for blocks with only one state","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-22T13:39:15.937801Z","downloads":1648371,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"8fa3b84fc5860dbc30fdf8cced02af68dffcf3fa","sha512":"9b7dc686bfa7937815d88c7bbc6908857cd6646b05e7a96ddbdcada328a385bd4ba056532cd1d7df9d2d7f4265fd48bd49ff683f217f6d4e817177b87f6bc457"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/unerR5MN/ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar","filename":"ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":125197,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar"},"mods\\dwdsb-1.5.1.jar":{"sha512":"449a7b2f3c7b4cf122eb4521bb400de3fd2145ae1ab6fd6e9aa4057e17305631ac5210b854f2af1c436177755d384c0d33e2cd03d221ea3d4f705079952e7e30","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"wA5VlakK","slug":"dwdsb","project_type":"mod","team":"qReLcCXx","title":"Discs Where Discs Shouldn't Be","description":"A vanilla-styled mod that adds 14 unique music discs into the game along with some simple musical baubles.","body":"<center>\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1WnNAkfbbua8R7EZWK7pp5m_AwxVwjOsB\">\n</center>\n<h1>Discs Where Discs Shouldn't Be</h1>\n<p>\nThis mod adds 14 unique music discs to your game.\nComposed by Jacob Thomas, these discs were crafted to fit the Minecraft style while \npushing the envelope on the original sound.

Once you have at least 12 eyes, you can follow them until you reach the Stronghold. You have to put <strong>the 12 custom eyes in the portal in order to open it</strong>. If there's a vanilla eye of ender in one of the frames, you can remove it by right clicking on it with a custom eye.</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\"><br /></span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PuRYpVn.png\" alt=\"The Eyes\" width=\"1042\" height=\"174\" /></span><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The Eyes are a really important part of End Remastered, just like Vanilla Ender Eyes, they allow you to activate the portal to the End.

Simply build a pipeline and you're good to go.\n\nThe part of the pipe with the protruding opening is the direction items will flow in. If there is no block in front of the pipe the items will shoot out, so be careful!\n\nPipes can also insert items into any block with an inventory like chests, hoppers, and barrels, and themselves.\nCopper Pipes are crafted just how you think they'd be- three copper in a row, an empty row, and three more copper.\n\nMoving And Dispensing Items:\n\nIf a Copper Pipe is pointing into air or water, it will automatically shoot out its items. To prevent this, placing something as simple as a Torch in front of it will suffice.\n\nCopper Pipes will deposit their items into inventories like Chests, Barrels, and the Copper Fitting. They can also take out these items from those blocks, making them easy to use for intersections and storage.\n\nCopper Pipes with Dispensers behind them will shoot items farther depending on their oxidization state and color, and Copper Pipes with Droppers behind them will shoot items out at a medium range, regardless of oxidization and color.\n\nCopper Pipes that are being powered by Redstone will \"shoot\" specific items like Arrows, Splash Potions, and Snowballs, making them more versatile.\n\nWaxed pipes are the fastest, while normal pipes are slightly slower.\n\nCopper Fittings will prevent the flow of items whilst being powered.\n\nSmoke And Water Leaking:\n\nCopper Pipes are able to leak water and smoke under specific circumstances.\n\nIf a Pipe is Waterlogged or Water is placed directly behind the Pipe, the water will move along the Pipeline. This is visualized with drops of water falling from pipes.\n\nWater will flow through up to 12 pipes, where it will then stop. By placing Copper Fittings in the Pipeline, you can renew the flow of water as much as you'd like.\n\nFarmland can stay damp if under a leaking pipe that's up to 12 blocks above it and Sugar Cane are able to \ngrow under these same circumstances, removing the need for you to place them next to water sources.\n\nAll mobs will be considered to be in water if under a pipe that's up to 12 blocks above them, meaning that all mobs will be extinguished if under a pipe, and Endermen will be damaged by walking under a Leaking Pipe.\n\nSmoke follows these same rules, needing a Lit Campfire to be placed behind the entry pipe. Copper Fittings will renew the flow of smoke.\n\nBee Hives and Bee Nests will count Smoking Pipes as Campfires, allowing Copper Pipes to be used in honey farming.\n\nOxidization, Waxing, & Lightning:\n\nAll Copper Pipes and Copper Fittings will oxidize over time. To prevent this, you can alt-click on one with a Honeycomb, or combine and Honeycomb and a Pipe/Fitting in a Crafting Table. Waxed Pipes will transport items faster, making them a more preferable choice.\n\nAlt-clicking on a Pipe or Fitting will remove its wax, and if it's unwaxed, will revert its oxidization stage by one.\n\nCopper Pipes and Copper Fittings can de-oxidize from lightning, but you'll have to set them up properly for it to work.\n\nWhen a Lightning Rod is triggered on top of (or directly next to) a pipe or fitting, electricity will surge through the entire pipeline.\n\nEach time a pipe or fitting receives electricity they'll de-oxidize by one stage, and glowing pipes/fittings will glow.\nIf a Pipe or Fitting is completely oxidized, you can put it in a furnace to Corrode it.\n\nVibrations:\n\nWhen a Copper Pipe's opening is exposed to air, it will pick up Vibrations and send them through the pipeline, which can be used to distract Wardens or work with Sculk's mechanics easier.\n\nAll Copper Pipes with an exposed opening will pick up Vibrations, though the Vibration particle will only appear if a Block or Entity that can listen to it is around; this can be controlled via tags, but keep in mind that this is purely visual- the Vibrations will still be emitted.\n\nNote Blocks will also be picked up by pipes, which will also be sent through pipelines like vibrations.\n\nCopper Fittings are not required to renew Vibrations as they can travel through entire pipelines on their own as of 1.10.\n\nOther:\n\nAlternate-Clicking on a pipe with a hoe will rotate it.\nPipes will bubble underwater.\n\n(Maybe they're not so simple after all..?)","published":"2022-01-23T01:50:55.704909Z","updated":"2024-05-05T04:32:07.360876Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":159639,"followers":255,"categories":["game-mechanics","storage","technology"],"additional_categories":["decoration"],"game_versions":["1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w42a","22w43a","22w45a","22w46a","1.19.3","23w04a","1.19.4","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20-pre3","1.20-pre4","1.20-pre5","1.20-pre6","1.20-pre7","1.20-rc1","1.20","1.20.1-rc1","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["AQBkrhtl","Sx9X49lI","3qmJSzdh","eW1laNA4","kAxbFORu","3MIOHabl","UlfOnH3U","6efDyM2A","Pjyvl2ag","oY1ZBxOw","kHxswnXH","gtuWYWeg","Xa9zwGHR","fHEx49EB","7oWoFnBM","IvsYaD7N","5IIpPDM4","oNYFCFUh","ApzBa6Up","xUGzErST","u5nPBEmk","wE0BlO3B","iGIHemfG","xm6k9R9p","rHZDMu5E","EZNePEz5","YlUnDpwJ","UvQBx25Q","NFv8fir1","BwnW8P6f","11GEdRk8","IFK4aVkQ","ExafmHT8","O4KfZL8f","mZjDvoCa","BoibvsBu","R3iwOJGr","fToOAJrL","4IZ3pnIQ","HqiLiKMi","3dtgrapp","Ze717MYv","mqmb5sfw","fo6V4hr5","VrYxGcg0","LtEo7Fqi","fQzVGfa5","95Hqzg01","e7FaUuF7","jv9W8HOA","t4mTUYnO","lh10V3r2","IA34tUwL","Bbv9W1V2","DW7nb3EV","Ev2KSSWR","yEo98Vbe","q8DOigeD","Dv34ewqS","6z9SSIsk","3kZPzEZF","f8hsWFFR","REsjlj43","QII3TzT1","FKt8JNOd","2wG0N40d","dd9U7ewC","dSBv3axo","oAWst0hS","Ec42ndUG","iuhPovqT","tINoAkAa","IJ5tVtsR","Lwq9reXT","wPuMjxmV","G9vP8wc0","DonIUBAf","TCmoc5Sl","4qLWHaik","aNc9MS3Y","RMObPif0","cKpjhpJs","Ogzd0CTk","4X6dOYLU"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/9r4ZkgSN/24da6f2b3298f0941a967e4b72f063cd48f3b636.png"},"version":{"id":"RMObPif0","project_id":"9r4ZkgSN","author_id":"2TIVL5E6","featured":true,"name":"1.16.1 (1.20.1)","version_number":"1.16.1-1.20.1","changelog":"- Fixed crashes caused by MixinExtras not being added as an annotation processor","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-17T22:59:41.257685Z","downloads":53460,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"c5cf7e0584155527b046f6938efbda4656534c50","sha512":"ae7884b0008037fca303ef7b77cabd54e2f8444208fae4dca888add4f3f7d54f10ea4b1045828aec26f0e0279144fb9c0382ee1c9b21b7c08894bb102f31ad9c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/9r4ZkgSN/versions/RMObPif0/SimpleCopperPipes-1.20.1-1.16.1.jar","filename":"SimpleCopperPipes-1.20.1-1.16.1.jar","primary":true,"size":1515625,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"9KawNmQc","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"embedded"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"AtHRJSUW","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"vIjhR1Yg","user":{"id":"1qFZskzr","username":"Treetrain1","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39657565?v=4","bio":"FrozenBlock mod developer","created":"2022-05-14T23:34:21.941598Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"vIjhR1Yg","user":{"id":"2TIVL5E6","username":"Lunade_","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87103914?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-12-25T21:32:15.110086Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"SimpleCopperPipes-1.20.1-1.16.1.jar"},"mods\\FarmersDelight-1.20.1-2.1.1+refabricated.jar":{"sha512":"f31a606f861afedd4d265e7150535519fe3d40d5a418769630897c38a41a64d767fe236167832760593700986706dab6f9f4979cbe5f6a0bad0fcd1323971573","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"7vxePowz","slug":"farmers-delight-refabricated","project_type":"mod","team":"w0r2K7UT","title":"Farmer's Delight Refabricated","description":"Modern Fabric port of the cooking and farming mod, \"Farmer's Delight\"","body":"![Farmer's Delight Refabricated Logo](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/55f4eef09b087d3b08a792e1c7c224e5796cbb71.png)\n\n## This is an unofficial Fabric port of vectorwing's Farmer's Delight.

Just press left click when cooking anything on a skillet or use a shovel on a placed down one!\n\n**🌽 Description**\n\n**Farmer's Delight** is a mod that gently expands upon farming and cooking in Minecraft.\n\nUsing a simple cooking system and a few familiar ingredients, you'll be able to prepare a wide variety of hearty meals: from sandwiches to salads and stews, from beautiful desserts to mouth-watering feasts, no ingredient will be left behind in your kitchen!\n\nIt also introduces a rich set of utilities: a way to **improve the very soil** your crops grow in, a brand new kind of tool to **scavenge resources** with, cute **decorations** for your builds, and many blocks and items to help you on your adventure!\n\nIt's time to farm a little bit of everything!\n\n \n**📖 Getting Started**\n\n**Follow the advancements!** Much of its progression is described through them. By default, press the (L) key to open the Advancements screen.\n\nIf you'd rather get a more straight-forward guide, we wrote a [Getting Started](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/Getting-Started) to help you learn the basics!\n\n \n**📝 FAQ**\n<details>\n<summary>Expand for FAQ</summary>\n\n**Q. How does this different from the other existing Farmer's Delight Fabric?**\n\nA. This port's main focus has been on simplicity and faithfulness to the original mod. This meant that only minor changes were made to accommodate the loader specific things.\n\nPackage names and all existing behavior has been kept the same. This means that FD addons can now easily be ported from Forge to Fabric with, ideally, no change at all as all the package names are the same.\n\n[A list of differences can be found here.](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/FarmersDelight/blob/1.20/information/Differences.md)\n\n**Q. Will existing addons work for this?**\n\nA. While porting existing Forge addons to Fabric will be trivial, already existing Fabric addons made for the old Fabric port will NOT work and they will have to update to reflect the new package structure.\n\n[A list of supported addons and integrations can be found here.](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/FarmersDelight/blob/1.20/information/Addons_And_Integrations.md)\n\nFeel free to ask for more compat layers, however, they will only be done if they are simple enough to be able to be done, anything more complicated and you're best to wait for a developer to support Farmer's Delight Refabricated or just accept that they might not, it's really up to them.\n\n**Q. Can I use this mod into my modpack?**\n\nA. Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n\n- Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n- Always read the changelogs! Minor and major versions can sometimes have breaking changes, which will be explained there.\n\n**Q. Will I keep old blocks from the other FD port?**\n\nA. The mods use the same IDs so yes.\n\n**Q. Will addons for the other port be updated to use this one instead?**\n\nA. That depends on them. Updating/porting a Forge addon is trivial but this will still take a bit of time and depends on the individual modder. So please be patient and don't harrass modders.\n\n**Q. Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?**\n\nA. Farmer's Delight Refabricated is currently being updated for 1.20+. Any other versions are currently discontinued.\n\n**Q. Are you going to backport this mod to versions before 1.15?**\n\nA. No. This mod will never be backported to older versions. The game's older codebases are entirely different, and usually missing important features this mod depends on.\nPlease, do NOT ask for backports!\n</details>","published":"2024-03-27T01:59:37.106681Z","updated":"2024-04-28T21:45:16.520969Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":116771,"followers":145,"categories":["decoration","equipment","food"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["M8bp9Dk5","J5zT5dIA","UFctor0l","ETe2oDvK","FMhV8TQg","X6fzggyI","QzcIQ62s","pnmeqDCQ","6MKCnUff","Qid8WxOf","Ti8scSIz","5dZdVy3m"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/7vxePowz/26e8448993e9bda4dba92b6e7a1a13d9c4333138.png"},"version":{"id":"5dZdVy3m","project_id":"7vxePowz","author_id":"84zsGbft","featured":false,"name":"Farmer's Delight Refabricated 2.1.1 - 1.20.1","version_number":"1.20.1-2.1.1","changelog":"- Fixed Cooking Pot interaction with Hoppers ([#39](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/FarmersDelight/issues/39))\n- Update es_mx (Spanish - Mexico) lang file ([#40](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/FarmersDelight/pull/40)) - TheLegendOfSaram","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-28T21:45:17.535649Z","downloads":86875,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"24e6e4ab7b41ab15ccebd09f38e7e4d69064699b","sha512":"f31a606f861afedd4d265e7150535519fe3d40d5a418769630897c38a41a64d767fe236167832760593700986706dab6f9f4979cbe5f6a0bad0fcd1323971573"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/7vxePowz/versions/5dZdVy3m/FarmersDelight-1.20.1-2.1.1%2Brefabricated.jar","filename":"FarmersDelight-1.20.1-2.1.1+refabricated.jar","primary":true,"size":6723291,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Xg35A4rS","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"fRiHVvU7","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"nfn13YXA","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"tEJPA4Ty","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"embedded"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"u6dRKJwZ","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"w0r2K7UT","user":{"id":"84zsGbft","username":"Pug","name":"Pug","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81167232?v=4","bio":"I just want to use my bio to say hi so yeah hi.","created":"2021-05-22T13:04:22.734485Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"w0r2K7UT","user":{"id":"BU21lLGA","username":"MehVahdJukaar","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24719182?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-21T07:42:29.648721Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"FarmersDelight-1.20.1-2.1.1+refabricated.jar"},"mods\\Aquamirae-6.jar":{"sha512":"c047063fb7b54cf107554992a9341470c622c178a89a1135c9204b347034bf9dfc757f09f1f96fcc20852868c0c11fb18ca7151ec0e2b87556f516011b0f59b1","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"k23mNPhZ","slug":"aquamirae","project_type":"mod","team":"sO83oKB2","title":"Aquamirae","description":"Ship graveyard with terrible deep sea creatures!","body":"<center><img style=\"display: inline;\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/FXUH2cx.jpg\" width=\"95%\" /></center>\n<br/>\n\n*The once endless ocean, the waters of which were raised from the depths by gusty winds, the ocean that was sailed by brave voyagers and fearsome flotillas of pillagers, is now chained in ice and snow.*\n\n*Frozen in time...

Critical striking is completely rng based, powered by secondary attributes.\n\n## 📦 Content\n\n### Entity Attributes:\n\n- Spell Power, one for each specific magic school (for example: `spell_power:fire`)\n- Spell critical chance (id: `spell_power:critical_chance`)\n- Spell critical damage (id: `spell_power:critical_damage`)\n- Spell haste (id: `spell_power:haste`), can be used to quicken spell casting or cooldowns\n\n### Status Effects:\n\n- One specifically for each introduced attribute, with a matching id (for example: `spell_power:fire`, `spell_power:critical_chance`)\n\n(All status effects come with fancy icons 😍)\n\n### Enchantments:\n\n- Universal Spell Power (named: \"Spell Power\"), increasing all spell damage\n- School limited Spell Power (for example: \"Sunfire\", increasing arcane and fire damage) \n- Secondary attribute enchantments (for example: \"Spell Critical Chance\")\n- \"Magic Protection\" (totally symmetric to Projectile Protection, but for magic)\n\n(All enchantments are fully configurable, and come with descriptions)\n\n# 🔧 Configuration\n\n**Server side** configuration can be found in the `config` directory, after running the game with the mod installed.\n","published":"2022-12-23T13:31:08.411187Z","updated":"2024-04-12T13:39:05.186271Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":437339,"followers":156,"categories":["library","magic"],"additional_categories":["adventure","game-mechanics"],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["OZt33z9y","8JZtHM36","FOc76ayi","ZIFDdYy8","Wzpqt33L","bE2Cpn06","wBSzMSuf","QMJuz1zi","7SbZEqA5","tuww90Eu","o5zzsgPA","6ffjOgGW","71FZTu9s","e2ggpysz","3e4ctFvH","aSo9SZuM","lME8r1AD","4b3xYbpW","LVyrxDzP","jHaKmMkR","wjkzk05R"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8ooWzSQP/eac53d793cb13193c3860d90c5e19e680fbc7cb5.png"},"version":{"id":"wjkzk05R","project_id":"8ooWzSQP","author_id":"CUHgJfv9","featured":false,"name":"0.10.2+1.20.1","version_number":"0.10.2+1.20.1","changelog":"# 0.10.2\n\nAPI Changes:\n- BREAKING! - Replaced several crucial types, most notably: MagicSchool -> SpellSchool\n- BREAKING! - Removed PHYSICAL_RANGED and PHYSICAL_MELEE schools\n- SpellSchools can now be added from external code\n- SpellSchool specifically, various trait calculation sources can now be added via API (for example: custom power/haste/crit sources)\n- EntityAttribute registration now happens at vanilla Attribute registry init, so custom AttributeResolver components are no longer neccesary to resolve attriubtes by ID\n- Optimized Spell Power related attribute container injections, (now it is possible to configure only PlayerEntity to get them, instead of LivingEntity)\n\nFunctional changes:\n- Update physical ranged school color\n- Improve the way how disabled Enchantments are handled\n- Fix enchantment config type requirement not working correctly for some cases\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-12T13:39:06.417266Z","downloads":45287,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"20c3a117783f4ae923c044b811f94d97b2ca8ebd","sha512":"87a650011b2e855ee74506895a61e934459ddc9c9ecd0d29ab119739ec3cebbbbfff2ccc8428c6bcfe45384800613394c20f69eaa12a6651716acd6ba47be0c6"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8ooWzSQP/versions/wjkzk05R/spell_power-0.10.2%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"spell_power-0.10.2+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":173576,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"X228bzUD","user":{"id":"CUHgJfv9","username":"ZsoltMolnarrr","name":"Molnár Zsolt","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4989469?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-07-04T18:48:27.207892Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"spell_power-0.10.2+1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\indium-1.0.30+mc1.20.4.jar":{"sha512":"3b9c9beef42f72bc75094595c92038c38e36fcde75890c73ced01aed4fb2a8a85cddb8edd2aa91ea6ed2dd41f8afedaa3dbca8f70c716197a7f2ee5b26060562","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Orvt0mRa","slug":"indium","project_type":"mod","team":"X5s94xjx","title":"Indium","description":"Sodium addon providing support for the Fabric Rendering API, based on Indigo","body":"Indium is an addon for the rendering optimisation mod [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), providing support for the Fabric Rendering API. The Fabric Rendering API is required for many mods that use advanced rendering effects, and is currently not supported by Sodium directly. Indium is based upon the reference implementation Indigo, which is part of Fabric API with source available [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.17/fabric-renderer-indigo). (licensed Apache 2.0)\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n## Which mods require Indium?\nAny mod that uses the Fabric Rendering API will require Indium when used with Sodium. These include: Campanion, Bits and Chisels, LambdaBetterGrass,\nContinuity, Packages, and many more. Some of these mods may function without an implementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.\n\n## Does Indium affect performance?\nIndium's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves impact performance. Indium will not provide a performance benefit over using only Sodium.\n\n## Is Indium a replacement for Sodium?\nNo, Indium is an addon mod for Sodium - you must use both mods together to get Fabric Rendering API support with Sodium's rendering optimisations.\n\n## Do I need Indium if I don't use Sodium?\nNo, Indigo is provided as part of Fabric API as the reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API. Indigo disables itself when Sodium is installed.\n\n## Is Fabric API required?\nYes. To use Sodium with mods that require the Fabric Rendering API, you need *both* Fabric API to provide the rendering API and Indium to implement the rendering API.\n\n## Will it be merged into Sodium?\nFabric Rendering API support is not currently a priority for the Sodium developers, and will not be explored until Sodium is in a more stable state.\n\n## Which versions of Sodium are supported?\nSodium 0.2.0 or newer is required for all versions of Indium. I support the latest stable versions of Sodium for 1.18 and 1.19. Iris may not always be compatible with the latest release or build of Indium - please ask the Iris support channels if you have issues.","published":"2021-07-19T17:56:39.449041Z","updated":"2024-02-06T00:32:19.293889Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":5011575,"followers":5990,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["Zk2jPxcx","uTvfCUBM","mfNlBb6U","1ApUEVoW","CVUGSVU0","Rxzic9a0","D0fLM4o1","ZxoJeTLg","TpvP0qDc","lK43uDfu","Rli2nU8i","H4bOnadw","H45YVREb","mJ7WqoOY","WG5jreCt","yTfou6df","BoAba4K3","KqmHL1pI","85NvAOjQ","tMamyl08","U94NcDpV","qqiFL8NF","M7szjcI4","WTH3T2cR","oYQsfz9e","9dgIzesu","yTh7W27h","OPwFzZCT","HIQfyNd3","hfBawPLH","6UQwWURe","Lue6O9z9","tD2IqHXC","nTorcOMQ","Aouse6P7"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"Aouse6P7","project_id":"Orvt0mRa","author_id":"M6f6rkfI","featured":true,"name":"Indium

Integration\nYou can configure Zoomify to only be able to zoom in when you are holding or carrying a spyglass.\nOr even just override the spyglass zoom with Zoomify!\n\nShow the spyglass overlay and play spyglass sound effects when using Zoomify.\n\n![Spyglass Integration Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/spyglass-integration-example.gif)\n\n### Transitions\n**14 different** transitions to choose from!\n\n- Instant\n- Linear\n- [Ease in Sine](https://easings.net/#easeInSine)\n- [Ease out Sine](https://easings.net/#easeOutSine)\n- [Ease in/out Sine](https://easings.net/#easeInOutSine)\n- [Ease in Quad](https://easings.net/#easeInQuad)\n- [Ease out Quad](https://easings.net/#easeOutQuad)\n- [Ease in/out Quad](https://easings.net/#easeInOutQuad)\n- [Ease in Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeInCubic)\n- [Ease out Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeOutCubic)\n- [Ease in/out Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeInOutCubic)\n- [Ease in Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeInExp)\n- [Ease out Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeOutExp)\n- [Ease in/out

Config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/individual-transition.png)\n\n### Relative Sensitivity\nReduce your mouse sensitivity based on the amount of zoom,\nso you have fine control over your player.\n\n![Relative Sensitivity Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/relative-sensitivity-example.gif)\n\n### Relative View Bobbing\nReduce the view bobbing effect based on the amount of zoom,\nso you can walk and zoom at the same time!\n\n![Relative View Bobbing Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/relative-view-bobbing-example.gif)\n\n### Cinematic Camera\nMake the mouse/camera smooth, like the zoom in [OptiFine](https://www.optifine.net).\n\n![Cinematic Cam Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/cinematic-cam-example.gif)\n\n### Affect Hand FOV\nTurn off this setting to prevent your hand from also being zoomed in!\n\n![Affect Hand FOV Turned Off Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/affect-hand-fov-disabled-example.gif)\n\n### Secondary Zoom\n\nCompletely separate zoom from normal Zoomify.\nAimed for content creators, features `Hide HUD While Zooming` option and longer zoom in times.\n\n![Secondary Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/secondary-zoom.gif)\n\n### Presets\n\nYou can reset to default, make Zoomify behave like OptiFine and others!\n\n### Smart Keybinding Detection\n\nOn first launch, if a keybinding is conflicting with Zoomify's zoom, a notification will appear notifying them of this.\n\n![Keybinding Conflict Detection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/keybind-conflict-detection.png)\n\n### Highly configurable\nAbsolutely **NO** hard-coded values. Everything about your zoom is configurable!\n\n### Control the zoom speed with seconds\nInstead of some stupid arbitrary value such as zoom speed, you can pick\nthe exact amount of seconds it will take to zoom in, with a separate setting for zooming out.\n\n### Credits\n- [Xander](https://github.com/isXander) - Developer\n- [MoonTidez](https://github.com/MoonTidez) - Logo designer\n\n####

Jungle](https://github.com/HexagonNico/UndergroundJungle/raw/1.20.1/forge/src/main/resources/logo.png)\n\nUnderground Jungle is a mod that adds an underground jungle biome and an underground jungle temple.\n\n## About\n\nUnderground Jungle adds an underground jungle biome and an underground jungle temple inspired by the one in Terraria that contains new blocks, two new mobs and a new set of tools that can be found inside the temple.\n\nThe underground jungle biomes tends to generate below hot and humid biomes such as jungles, but might generate under other biomes as well. The biome consists in patches of mud and jungle grass, a lush green grass that can spread to mud blocks and keeps the same green color in all biomes.\n\nThe temple is a rare structure full of traps found in the underground jungle. Every temple has a treasure chest and a temple key that you need to open the treasure chest. The treasure chest will contain one tool from the temple set. These tools can mine every block in the vanilla game, they are faster than any vanilla tool, and they cannot be destroyed by explosions, but they have a lower durability.\n\nJungle zombies can spawn in the underground jungle biome and mossy skeletons can spawn inside the temple. Both these mobs can inflict the poison effect to players if they are hit.\n\n### Main mod page\n\nCurseforge: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/underground-jungle\n\nModrinth: https://modrinth.com/mod/underground-jungle\n\nIf you find this mod on other distribution platforms, these are NOT managed by me.\n\n### Additional information\n\nThe fabric version of the mod requires the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n\n### Check out my other mods\n\n* [Spider Caves](https://modrinth.com/mod/spider-caves): Adds a spider cave biome and a spider armor\n\n## Questions and answers\n\n**Q**: Can I use this in my modpack?\n\n**A**: Yes.

chat message sent from 1.19 and onwards. Removing them makes it impossible to track and associate your chat messages with your Minecraft client, and, by extension, Microsoft account.\n\n**As of 1.19.1, it also disables Player Chat Reporting**\n\nPlease notice that, while I am aware of [Guardian](https://github.com/nodusclient/guardian) and certain other exploits that allow you to counteract reporting systems on the client against the will of the server, I am consciously choosing to not integrate them as part of this mod. No Chat Reports will only remain effective on the client side if the server allows it to be. If you do not like servers that enforce chat signing and fully support chat reporting - I advise to simply not play on them.\n\nAlso, while there are many plugins out there that \"borrow\" the name and even icon of NoChatReports, please be aware that **I have not authored any of them** and cannot say how well they do their job.\n\n## Installation and Usage:\n\nNoChatReports supports both Fabric and Forge, just download the version for your respective modloader and game version. It can be installed on either the client, server, or on both sides, and will function differently depending on which sides it is present on:\n\n**1. Only Client:** The client will refuse to send the account's public key to the server, and signatures will be stripped from the messages that you send. This way it won't be useful to try and report your messages, as there will be no proof that they were actually sent from your account. The server will relay them unless the `enforce-secure-profile` option is set to `true` in the `server.properties` file (which it is by default since 1.19.1)\n\nIf the server does require you to sign messages and you are on either 1.19.1 or 1.19.2, you will not be able to join the server unless you agree to send signed messages (NoChatReports will supply a warning screen), if you are on 1.19.3 or higher, you will still be able to join the server, but will not be able to use chat-related commands (other commands do still work)\n\n**2. Only Server:** Clients will still attach signatures when sending messages to the server, but the server will strip them before relaying them to other players. This way chat reporting will not work for any players that join. You can enable the conversion of player to system messages in the config, to prevent players without the mod from seeing them as \"Not Secure\"\n\nAs of 1.20.2 the server cannot disable the \"unsigned messages\" warning on the client. It can only be disabled if the client has NoChatReports (or a similar mod) installed.\n\n**3. Both Client and Server:** Signatures will be stripped on the client side before sending messages to the server, which will not attempt to verify message signatures. Chat reporting and \"Only Show Secure Chat\" will not function, and players will be notified that those features are disabled by the mod when trying to use them.\n\nAlthough NoChatReports can function when it is only present on one of either sides, NoChatReports can be configured to demand itself to be installed on the respective other side in order to play. This way you can install it on the server and require all clients that join to have NoChatReports installed, but you can also leave it server-only if you prefer.\n\nAdditionally, if installed on the client, NoChatReports will disable Telemetry (similar to what [No Telemetry](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-telemetry) does).\n\nTo make sure that your server is compatible with NoChatReports, you can take a look at [this part of the wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players).\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe configuration files are located in the `NoChatReports` subfolder of the default config folder.\n\n`NCR-Client.json` stores Client-Side settings\n\n`NCR-Common.json` stores Server-Side settings\n\n`NCR-Encryption.json` stores Chat Encryption settings (Only effective on the client)\n\n`NCR-ServerPreferences.json` stores Per-Server Signing Modes\n\nYou can find more information [here](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/).\n\n## Chat Encryption\nI have put together a video dedicated to Chat Encryption, watching it will help you to learn how it is used (and whether you should): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7RzNP32k-s\n\n## Documentation:\nYou can find documentation and other information relevant to this mod on the [wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/). It currently features the following articles:\n- [Configuration Files](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/)\n- [Protecting Server Players](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players/)\n- [How to Get Safe Server Status](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status)\n- [I Got Banned!](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/I-Got-Banned)\n- [To Encrypt or Not to Encrypt](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/To-Encrypt-or-Not-To-Encrypt)\n- [The Realms Question](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/The-Realms-Question)\n\n\n## For Developers:\nIf you develop your own mod, plugin or other server software that in some way prevents chat reports, you can make clients with No Chat Reports installed recognize servers running your software as safe. I wrote [a small article](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status) about this. For clarification or further inquiries - contact me via Discord, link in \"External resources\".\n\n## Reasoning:\nSee my videos for an explanation of how message signatures and chat reporting work in the game, their failures and the reasoning behind the creation of this mod:\n1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAUEMlugyw\n2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DobmW1ZUcbQ\n3.

(/paintexport &lt;filename&gt; and /paintimport &lt;filename&gt;)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can import/export paintings between worlds and servers.</li>\n<li>Paintings are imported from and exported to a \"paintings\" folder inside your minecraft directory.</li>\n<li>In order to import a painting in survival mode, you need to hold an empty canvas and a full palette on your hands.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Added a <strong>brush opacity</strong> meter. Using this, you can basically mix colors on the canvas itself!</p>\n<p>The canvas and palette in the GUI can now be <strong>moved</strong>. Move them out of the way to see your reference objects!</p>\n<p>Added helpful <strong>tooltips</strong> for some parts of the painting GUI (can be toggled on and off easily)</p>\n<p>Item textures are tweaked, palette texture now shows how many basic colors it has.</p>\n<p>The game now remembers the last color you had selected when you close the GUI, so you don't have to reselect it when you reopen it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>New in 1.16.4-1.1:</strong></h3>\n<p>There is now a <strong>color picker</strong> tool on <strong>full palettes</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Click its icon to switch to color picking</li>\n<li>Then click and hold to pick a color on the canvas and bring it to one of the custom color slots on the palette</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/2dcsjdZ/color-picker.gif\" alt=\"Color picker\" width=\"588\" height=\"331\" /></p>\n<p>There are also some <strong>sound effects</strong> now, because it was too boring to paint in silence.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Usage Guide</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>First you need to craft (or get from the creative inventory) a palette and a canvas. Crafting recipes are given below.</li>\n<li>When crafting a palette, any combination of dyes will do, but you need at least one dye.</li>\n<li>You can then fill the palette with other dyes if you want.</li>\n<li>There are currently four kinds of canvases. The basic one is 1 block sized. The others are 1x2, 2x1 and 2x2 block sized.</li>\n<li>Using a canvas (by itself) with right-click lets you view its content.</li>\n<li>Using a palette (by itself) lets you open the palette interface, where you can mix colors to create custom ones.</li>\n<li>Using a canvas in one hand and a palette on the other lets you open both interfaces at once, where you can paint on the canvas using the colors on your palette. You can mix colors here as well.</li>\n<li>Another option is to place the canvas on an easel and right click the easel with a palette at hand.</li>\n<li>The color mixing rules work the same way as the vanilla leather armor dyeing mechanic.</li>\n<li>Change the brush size or opacity with the mouse wheel or by clicking on the GUI element</li>\n<li>Undo mistakes with the CTRL+Z shortcut</li>\n<li>After painting a canvas, you can use it on a wall similar to vanilla paintings to hang it on the wall.</li>\n<li>Hitting the hanged canvas or breaking a block it rests on will drop it back as an item.</li>\n<li>Sign a painting to give it a name and make it unchangeable.</li>\n<li>Copy signed paintings by crafting them together with an empty canvas of the same shape.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Crafting Recipes</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/Vpf9MsM/canvas-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting a canvas\" width=\"400\" height=\"159\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/7rwQHrr/long-canvas-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting long canvas\" width=\"400\" height=\"142\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/dByhxvw/tall-canvas-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting tall canvas\" width=\"400\" height=\"145\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/26jnbYv/large-canvas-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting a large canvas\" width=\"400\" height=\"134\" /></p>\n<p>To craft a palette, you need at least one kind of dye:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/7Xy8959/palette-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting a palette\" width=\"400\" height=\"134\" /></p>\n<p>You can fill an existing palette with other dyes later:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/L8V5BsS/palette-fill.png\" alt=\"Filling a palette\" width=\"400\" height=\"132\" /></p>\n<p>You can copy signed paintings:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/PW9LKrG/copying-recipe.png\" alt=\"Copying a signed painting\" width=\"400\" height=\"132\" /></p>\n<h5>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Crafting an easel:</span></h5>\n<h5><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/jWg0Xkx/java-zva-Bwzjr8-A.png\" alt=\"Easel recipe\" width=\"400\" height=\"178\" /></h5>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Community</h4>\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https://discord.gg/kAXdzKGXtW\">Discord server</a> now, where you can share your creations with the world!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>About shaders:</h4>\n<p>The latest versions (1.18.2, 1.19.2 and above) seem to work fine with custom shaders, but there is no guarantee that it will work with every shader.

Slot groups are collections of slots for a certain body part or more vague area. By default there are 6 slot groups (head, chest, legs, feet, offhand, hand) that can have slots added to them, but more groups can be added if desired. Trinkets' UI is intuitive to use, accessible, and attempts to do away with clutter. Its system means that you'll never have a slot that's not used for anything, as mods request the slots they want.\n\nFor basic tutorials and comprehensive documentation, visit this project's [wiki](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets/wiki/Home).\n","published":"2021-06-08T00:05:32.472592Z","updated":"2024-05-26T19:08:53.744849Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1317593,"followers":1036,"categories":["equipment","library","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17-rc2","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["70Ajg5iP","dRgbv7A2","29Jd2Dm4","qpiOPBB9","R2UW6ejS","FdJA5sbK","DtvgyMK2","vOuy3Z5S","XqLNMi9J","WiXqMygm","oLUBJhyv","9qrmAiwv","OLwsMJv4","5zEAvqnX","A5kxdEY3","z8ProfKL","e563ycts","tJ23Vcff","AHxQGtuC","7aQD4OG8","SGjPO8H9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5aaWibi9/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"AHxQGtuC","project_id":"5aaWibi9","author_id":"R6WsWKy9","featured":false,"name":"Trinkets 3.7.2","version_number":"3.7.2","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-11T04:25:11.224830Z","downloads":213418,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"d58cc8759587f03f320f188972ca66baa788d008","sha512":"bedf97c87c5e556416410267108ad358b32806448be24ef8ae1a79ac63b78b48b9c851c00c845b8aedfc7805601385420716b9e65326fdab21340e8ba3cc4274"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5aaWibi9/versions/AHxQGtuC/trinkets-3.7.2.jar","filename":"trinkets-3.7.2.jar","primary":true,"size":238532,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"F0xlmrbH","user":{"id":"R6WsWKy9","username":"Emi","name":"Emi","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/14813658?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-10-26T21:52:52.726926Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"trinkets-3.7.2.jar"},"mods\\coroutil-fabric-1.20.1-1.3.7.jar":{"sha512":"4a03363dd9cfd517eb04bea77779c88e74f12c1dacadc726869cb9b595348d615e50041893ad72155f7ac2c359219604710d6157dec95a46fe0e598ef5642035","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"rLLJ1OZM","slug":"coroutil","project_type":"mod","team":"nnhTUinU","title":"CoroUtil","description":"Shared library mod for Corosus's mods","body":"Main Util mod with all the fixin's\n\nThis mod is a giant collection of common code used between all my mods.

However, you can run the command `/worldhost ip` to get an IP that can be used with tunneling. Do note, however, that not using the friends system could increase ping. If you don't want the ping increase, you can run `/worldhost tempip` to get a *temporary* server IP that lasts for at least 60 seconds. Clients who connect within the 60 seconds will remain connected. If you plan to never use the friends system, you can disable it in the mod settings (requires [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu)).\n\n## How does this mod work?\n\nThis mod has a server that your client connects to, this server is used to communicate with other clients using World Host. \n\n1. When your friend wants to join you, your friend's client asks the server for an IP address to connect to. \n2. The server then asks your client to create a join mode (`JoinType` in the protocol). There are two join mods: UPnP and Proxy. \n3. UPnP mode is tried first. Your client tries to open a temporary port forward in your router that your friends client can use to connect to you directly. \n4. If UPnP succeeds, your client tells the server the port to use, then the server tells your friend's client your IP and the port number. \n5. If UPnP fails, then your client tells the server to use Proxy mode.

[Discord](https://short.isxander.dev/discord)\n\n## What if I want to enable some bug fixes, but not others?\nDebugify has a configuration GUI accessible by Fabric's [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu).\nIf you don't want to it, there is always the configuration file located at\n`.minecraft/config/debugify.json`\n\n![configuration menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/191992486-4ba9bd8f-db37-4021-b302-7f54701d8b08.png)\n\n## Client, or Server?\nDebugify includes many fixes for both the client and server (all server fixes also apply to client).\nSo you should definitely use it on both.\n\n## Can I include this in my modpack?\nYes! Of course! I even added a little feature in the mod for you! The constant updates may be exhausting to maintain,\nso I added a config option that defaults new bug fixes to off, until you get round to looking at it.\n\n## Credits\n- [**isXander**](https://github.com/isXander) -

(primarily used to support the random model feature, the config screen, and allow textures set in models to vary like in OptiFine)\n\n#### Highly recommended\n- [Entity Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/entityculling): This mod does wonders for reducing entity rendering lag, doing even more than Sodium's included entity culling. This is very beneficial when using animation heavy packs like Fresh Animations.\n\n\n## Fresh Animations?\nYes.\n\nit works :)\n\n<img width=\"450\" src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/images/2f32dbeadc25e46ef6c56f0e47e5eb5d305c8ea2.png\">\n\n<br>\n\n[Download Fresh Animations](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/fresh-animations-v1-0/)\n\n\n## Features & OptiFine differences & Known Bugs\n\nUp-to-date feature details page : [Features & Optifine differences](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/blob/master/FEATURES.md)\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n> **Q:** Do all OptiFine CEM resource packs work?\n\n**A:** Most packs work fine, but I'm sure there are some exceptions, report any found issues [here](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/issues), or on my [discord](https://discord.com/invite/rURmwrzUcz).\n\n> **Q:** What's different between EMF and dorianpb's [CEM](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem)?\n\n**A:** EMF is in a complete state and has a nearly 1 to 1 parity with OptiFine CEM, EMF also does a few extra things like player animations and armor model support, with more ideas on the way :)\n\nEMF also does things differently under the hood with little to no hardcoding of support for vanilla models. Allowing full CEM support for various modded entities.\n\n> **Q:** Backports?\n\n**A:** Backports to 1.18 & 1.19 are planned.\nBackports to version 1.17 and below are not planned at this time.\n\n## License\n\nEMF is licensed under the [GNU Lesser Public License](LICENSE), version 3.0\n\n## Hosting Partner deal\n\n[![image](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BVzZfTc1/images/bfb592538f8206a6a2d72d19c90714bea91b0e07.png)](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=641)","published":"2023-03-31T23:58:40.453948Z","updated":"2024-04-30T16:41:16.485547Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2797558,"followers":2186,"categories":["mobs","utility"],"additional_categories":["decoration"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20-pre1","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5-rc2","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["yYaRtPUw","nXG5ZTWm","pcLQFqon","rVKOnrA7","T7mzJLz6","Dea94PIY","DjswzKtj","aDp7snRT","V2OyfXxm","Xd7QIIv1","GlVrMJfd","TEAO0eWy","6WfVnhiq","3ArUcFku","zTnuaNyR","I8BdGIyR","7bzU6chG","deVKWS49","MjDE57Jw","weH0Em4N","OZhKhqbO","Y4ERRvDT","7eRoc49u","8GH17mIS","NZKwy6yr","AzRidGwG","IL4RqqYZ","mOmY1cMH","EYEiSxf5","PuJLEdhx","5v32yTeK","F2rVuihD","kouKrQ96","ZZGFPXZF","ORrfX7aq","OPyB18gz","yVjuZyf5","e9hB4Qyw","NF2Ro84F","yHUWdpcz","nqu0vi2x","lu9zjvWC","n1DH6PLf","VfoKtE8J","akfHUoQf","TVhwNuR0","4jkePyqP","E6OJ69z6","ZAuTqMfx","c9lEcqYf","30r5YeHU","LnM9TQxd","wEcxaFJT","slWSM9OY","9ODYgM48","n6EyQyeN","b1pJegrh","p1Qt8SIh","33ddTlVK","VBeUopG1","S8VuZDQ4","nIQedooe","PETiI2Yb","yGROrq68","8FU1BYfi","JtRlIyBy","z0tRTgFX","9N7ilgif","hVYDL7YQ","kFcIMH1Z","r0UjM8gx","NtxuH8Wk","toEX8PUQ","hBdLuluo","L5j5Cgt6","Fhs6XUdV","j6G5CGoD","UTk9KIPl","zO7oFMiv","4e3OPRfB","eg7GqpgR","KKMsC88r","h4PnMR7D","AXMXly1R","K22doPG2","F3Urf59I","BA8z5Ryk","P6h6WCIY","PRB8TBBT","GZoWb3Sj","DqAqkeNx","IvKEtlkS","8iNRv6h2","Gnq4IVE1","EGtndKuU","9GIq2ND0","z5WFPrA6","zdcSsI7C","5VBMcfOB","OsioKrT1","xOy316Zc","Ac9PxwNw","1pzWwAvR","74Yx8tM6","WNdlhpAM","fbZGMUWW","KZVwrmUQ","TbpHIXxk","SS5qaBrE","8oFou220","zGa2nXth","ZnkxeBpm","ZVchszyB","tcrjMnUN","4seBWMhe","u3VqNoAu","c7TDawJ9","4ZslB2Hx","QEQnfRIO","uv7jW0CE","VifrfxZJ","5Pum9sao","r3qto42X","vyuiguoP","hxDtTc1Q","n5YI6Zh6","SH3Z72mF","S9HtDtJv","yvWntDTo","4vJjL6YG","95DrIgKD","7qhkYutC","9BeU4JMZ","DOvpgsS7","3DUWVimm","GCiXd1DU","lfYHLBCj","HuiMDCpB","KneJBt8W","dVfrkFFQ","rfh88j45","bwjbN1G7","kakr6cxQ","IzAfhCj5","rGuR7oQZ","fMRe5pGZ","652AHAwn","2hVd4znq","bCmmruN5","F1JjnEjo","mWAFiRcK","wa38cdv3","SfWhB6Bd","7bxh2EoP","aFlca15F","up2Xg2sy","jVIxXxpT","dzyn3ag2","mtJzKD3q","ORJKgPNp","rD5uCHNg","khwkB6ra","BitxFUOE","K0xj45PZ","9xVJZ8Xr","xvYCCPha","cqKSqPQH","gpqniM0d","QWCOTizL","ch6lB4Mh","ZBKoFavY","nAaR07o2","JN7NY56L","at9xKHYT","9PuZ3Kv1","sZcSLicd","S7FrTSoe","nYfJt8sH","OUq3XNDY","5SZ2FbHC","BzcsKF0w","av84l2vE","9BVLcBub","jkLvxFFA","g2i5i750","FTmtYNdf","84vLaMxp"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/7a6acd528931a1a0d1b60fd0925b88227fb345cc.png"},"version":{"id":"jkLvxFFA","project_id":"4I1XuqiY","author_id":"rLbuLV6t","featured":false,"name":"[EMF] Entity Model Features 2.0.2","version_number":"2.0.2","changelog":"2.0.2\n- fixed the first person hand settings not getting reset correctly in 2.0.1\n- added the `is_swinging_right_arm` & `is_swinging_left_arm` boolean variables, \nused to distinguish right and left arm swinging in biped models, if no arm is swinging both should be false, if `swing_progress > 0` then one of these should be true.\n- added support for an optional `player_cape.jem` model file to be used for better animating the player cape\n`player_cape.jem` only contains a `cloak` part, positioned exactly as it is in the regular `player.jem`,\n  if this model is present it will render in a special way that will not apply the vanilla animations to the cape.\n  Allowing much easier custom animations\n  *(note this jem file can not be exported by the EMF config, but the `player.jem` exported model will work perfectly for it, as of v2.0.2)*\n\nThe only transforms EMF applies to `player_cape.jem` before rendering & custom animating is:\n- rotating the cape 180 degrees around the `y` axis.

Welcome to Dungeon Now Loading! Explore and discover, curious dungeoneers!\n\n# Goal\nOur goal is simple: to add 100 new challenging, but fair dungeons and bosses to the world of Minecraft. Minecraft is a sandbox game and players find their own way to enjoy the game, but we believe that there are players that want difficult challenges that demand more skills and knowledge from Minecraft. Our objective is to fill in that gap by adding fun challenges in the shape of dungeons and bosses, while providing more tools that the players can use to face the challenges. We update the mod regularly and every 1% increase in the percentage will be an update that adds in a new structure and boss or a significant update that changes the gameplay of the dungeons.

You can roll into any direction you are heading (forwards, backwards, sideways, etc...)\n\nThe combat roll ability has 4 seconds cooldown by default.  (Server side configurable)\n\nCooldown of your combat roll ability can be seen on the main UI (aka HUD). (Client side configurable)\n\nExhaust (aka hunger) is added to the player upon rolling (Server side configurable)\n\nRoll ability can only be used when player is: not using item, not jumping, not swimming.\n\n**New!** Now with invulnerability frames! (Disabled by default, can be turned on at `config/combatroll/server.json5`)\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## Attributes\n\nThese new entity attributes determine the properties of the combat roll ability.\n\n`combatroll:distance` determines how far the player rolls (the default distance is 3 blocks, server configurable). For example:\n\n`/give @s leather_boots{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:distance\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:3.0, Operation:0,Slot:\"feet\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497593, -201178, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n`combatroll:recharge` determines how quickly the cooldown of the roll ability recovers. For example: \n\n`/give @s leather_leggings{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:recharge\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:0.5, Operation:1,Slot:\"legs\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497593, -201177, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n`combatroll:count` determines how many times a player can roll before having to wait for recharging (by default a player has 1 roll). For example: \n\n`/give @s leather_helmet{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:count\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:2, Operation:0,Slot:\"head\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497594, -201177, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## Enchantments\nImprove various aspects of your combat roll ability with these enchantments.\n\n### Mulit-Roll\nCan be enchanted on helmets - Grants extra rolls (+1 roll / level)\n\n### Acrobat\nCan be enchanted on chests and legs - Increases the recharge speed of the roll cooldown (by +10% / level)\n\n### Longfooted\nCan be enchanted on boots - Increases the distance of your rolls (by 1 block / level).\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔧 Configuration\n\n&zwnj;\n\n### Fabric\n\nClient side settings can be accessed via the [Mod Menu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu).\n\n### Forge\n\nClient side settings can be accessed in Main Menu &gt;

Thank you all so much! If anyone has any ideas for new cave biomes, feel free to suggest some!</i> </center>\n\nProfundis is a world generation mod which adds <b>seven</b> new vanilla-styled underground biomes to the game: the Frozen Caves, the Mushroom Caves, the Molten Caves, the Amethyst Caves, the Black Caves, the Arid Caves, and the Floral Lush Caves. These seven new underground biomes make the depths of the world significantly more diverse—what was once just three underground biomes is now ten!\n\n<i>Profundis is a server-side mod, meaning it can be installed on a server and clients can join without needing to install a mod, much like a plugin! It can also be installed on a client for singleplayer!</i>\n\n<h3> Biomes </h3>\n\n❄The Frozen Caves typically generates below cold regions of the world, and has icicles hanging from the ceiling with small ice and snow patches on the ground. Aquifers generating here have a layer of ice on the top, just like frozen lakes and rivers on the surface. Redstone is also extrememly abundant here.\n\n🍄The Mushroom Caves can generate beneath more humid biomes. They have mycelium patches on the ground, with a plethora of small red and brown mushrooms generating everywhere. Huge mushrooms also spawn, although they spawn more often in large caves than small caves. Shelf Fungi line the walls, occasionally glowing with Shroomlights, in addition to the biome's higher rate of Glow Lichen.\n\n🌋The Molten Caves can generate in almost any environment. They have lava deltas meandering throughout the stony slopes of the caves, with an abundance of lava springs as well. Basalt columns similar to those in the Basalt Deltas also spawn, although not as frequent as in the Nether. Small patches of Smooth Basalt can occasionally generate on cave surfaces in the Deepslate layer as well. Iron is more abundant here.\n\n🔮The Amethyst Caves generate underneath hillier areas. They are filled with beautiful Amethyst Veins, with calcite and smooth basalt cracks in the cave walls. The crystals leave a gentle glow, alluring miners with their serenity.\n\n⚫The Black Caves generate underneath hillier areas, on the opposite side of valleys as Amethyst Caves. They have walls of Tuff, Deepslate, and Blackstone, hence the name. They also lack Glow Lichen, making it difficult to see in large caverns.\n\n🟧The Arid Caves generate under hotter areas. They have floors of sand and red sand, with sand in higher levels and red sand below deepslate level. The walls are made up of Terracotta bands of a variety of colours. They generate much like Frozen Caves, but in hotter biomes and rarer.\n\n🌸The Floral Lush Caves are a variant of Lush Caves. They are exactly identical, except with a floor made of a variety of flowers. Pink Pedals coat the floor, while a mix of all flowers native to the Flower Forest grow in the moss.\n\nAll of the cave biomes' generation can be disabled individually in the config by simply changing a value.\n\n<h3>Structures</h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n🪵Cabins generate in every Vanilla and Profundis cave biome, but not in barren caves. They are small to mid-sized bunkers, originally constructed as small bases for miners. They each contain a few functional blocks such as furnaces and crafting tables, plus barrels with loot. The barrels typically have mediocre loot with a pickaxe thrown in, but occasionally contain more valuable treasure. In addition, the loot found in the barrels matches what biome the structure spawns in.\n\n🧊Ice Dungeons are a variant on regular Monster Room dungeons that spawn in Frozen Caves. They contain an icy arena with a Skeleton Spawner and 8 pre-spawned Strays (I opted to not use a Stray Spawner as to not contradict with Vanilla's precedent on Strays; if you would like that to change let me know!). They additionally contain four barrels full of typical dungeon loot plus snow and ice.\n\n🍄Mushroom Houses are an uncommon structure generating beneath Mushroom Fields and in Mushroom Caves. They are non-hostile and contain a few chests of loot, plus some standard utilities. Loot is not very rewarding, but can be a useful source of food in a pinch.\n\n🔮Amethyst Dungeons are a slightly more difficult version of regular Monster Room Dungeons, generating in Amethyst Caves. They contain one Zombie spawner and one Skeleton spawner, and a Diamond Block in the middle as a reward. \n\n⛲️Sanctuaries are underground fountains generating in Lush Caves and Floral Lush Caves. They contain a Gold Block and a rare blue Axolotl.\n\n🏮Blackstone Lanterns are small lightposts generating in Black Caves. They contain one barrel in the center of the structure—but make sure to open the barrel at night for optimum loot! If opened during the day, their loot will be lackluster.\n\n🗿Deep Statues are uncommon humanoid statues generating in Frozen Caves, Mushroom Caves, Amethyst Caves, Black Caves, and Arid Caves. They contain eight Iron Blocks in the head of the structure.\n\n\n\n<br><i>If any of you have any ideas for new cave biomes or structures please let me know on my GitHub!

We simply add onto Complementary so we obviously don't fall into the green zone. We have had many conversations about this topic with Emin and came to a mutual agreement to distribute it through a patcher where none of Emin's code gets distributed (and by that not breaking the license) and the user has to have Complementary Shaders installed in order to get our add-on. All parties profit from this method.\n## When does Euphoria Patches update?\nEuphoria Patches Updates Immediately after a new Complementary Version is out. This includes dev versions.

It includes support for a <em>bunch</em> of modded dimensions.\n</p>\n\n## Adding Custom Sounds\n<p>To use custom sounds, all you have to do is create a small resource pack with the namespace <code>travelerstitles</code>. In the <code>sounds</code> folder, you can add any or all of three custom sounds, named <code>dimension.ogg</code>, <code>biome.ogg</code>, and <code>waystone.ogg</code>. Each of these sounds will play when entering a new dimension, biome, and waystone, respectively. If no custom sound is provided for any of these, then no sound will play for the respective type of title.\n</p>\n\n## Additional Customization\n<p>Using lang files in resource packs, you can add your own dimension &amp; biome titles!<br />\nDimensions use a lang entry format like the following:</p>\n<p><code>\"travelerstitles.namespace.dimensionname\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n<p>Biomes use the same lang entries as always, guaranteeing built-in support for any mod's biomes, like so:</p>\n\n<p><code>\"biome.namespace.biomename\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n\n<p>However, should you want to change a vanilla or modded biome's title without potentially affecting other areas of the game that might use the biome's translation, you can use a special format specifically for this mod via the following:\n</p>\n\n<p><code>\"travelerstitles.biome.namespace.biomename\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n\n<p>Both dimensions and biomes also support an optional <code>color</code> lang entry which will override the configured default text color for that specific dimension or biome.

Well you came to the right place!\n\nThis Mod serves as an addon to many popular mods and is meant to fill in the gaps by adding all the blocks that such mods add in all wood types currently installed.\n\nEvery block type added is available in ALL wood types.\n\nWith this mod you won't need extra compatibility addons and instead only rely on a single universal one! It's all automatic!\n\nAdditionally the mod will try to convert any block from other uninstalled compat mods into its equivalent ones.\n\n<center>\n\n## 🪑 Supported Blocks🪑\n</center>\n\n### Quark\n- Posts\n- Stripped posts\n- Hedges\n- Bookshelves\n- Vertical Planks\n- Ladders\n- Chests\n\n### Farmers Delight\n- Cabinets\n\n### Twilight Forest\n- Hollow Logs\n- Banisters\n\n### Decorative Blocks\n- Seats\n- Palisades\n- Supports\n- Beams\n\n### Architects Palette\n- Boards\n- Railings\n\n### Valhesia Structures\n- Posts\n- Cut Posts\n\n### Another Furniture\n- Tables\n- Chairs\n- Shelves\n- Flower Boxes\n- Shutters\n- Drawers\n- Benches\n\n### Storage Drawers\n- Drawers\n\n### Furnish\n- All wooden blocks\n\n### Builders and Craft Additions\n- All wooden blocks\n\n### Mosaic Carpentry\n- Mosaics\n\n### MrCrayfish Furniture Mod\n- All wooden blocks\n\n### Twigs\n- Tables\n\n### Macaw's Mods\n- Fences\n- Windows\n- Bridges\n- Lights\n- Paths\n- Furnitures\n- Rooves\n\n<center>\n\n## ❓ F. A. Q. ❓\n</center>\n\nQ: How the heck does this work?\n> A: Magic.\n\nQ: Is this compatible with other compat mods?\n> A: Yes, I've included a list of many popular compat mods. The mod will do its best not to register stuff that's already in them when they are installed\n\nQ: I'm a mod author, could I use this mod to add support to my blocks?\n> A: Yes! The mod includes a very simple and easy to use API with which modders can register an entire block definition in only 10 lines! The mod will automatically generate all assets automatically\n\nQ: Can you add support for \"x\" wood type?\n> A: Go try the mod\n\nQ: A block type isnt supported, can I add it myself?\n> A: Not directly as registration cant be conditional and cant depend on config files. If you are a modder and know code you can make a pull request to the mod or use the EveryCompatAPI class directly in your mods (check their javadocs & mod modules for info)\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

No need for placing the whole box on the ground for checking contents or adding a few item stacks! When you want to extract an item, easily scroll through all items in the box to get what you want. And believe it or not, this works with Ender Chests, too!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2Nqc3go.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X0ssWwh-owo\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Shulker Boxes and Ender Chests are so damn useful for storing and transporting many items. But why do you always have to place them on the floor to use them? Time to change that!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In any interface, simply hold shift when hovering the container item and you'll <strong>see all of its contents</strong> in the item tooltip. And if you just quickly want to add a few items, simply <strong>right-click them on the box/chest item in your inventory</strong>. You can do the same without holding an item to <strong>extract items from a box/chest</strong>. To control which item you extract simply use the scrolling wheel to cycle through all the contents. Very useful!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2Nqc3go.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/577/2022-03-13_10.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/578/2022-03-13_10.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Right-click a shulker box item to extract contents stack by stack</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Hold shift to see contents of a shulker box in your inventory</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2Nqc3go.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Forge?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Install my <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod and do it directly in-game!</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Fabric?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Editing configs directly in-game has not yet been implemented. Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I

stuttering when generating new chunks","body":"# StutterFix\n\n<p>StutterFix is a mod that allows you to configure the main threads of the game, allowing you to control stuttering. By default, the mod already comes with an approximate configuration to reduce stuttering.</p>\n\n<p>The new version 0.1.8 allows you to configure threads, I added a new option in the menu.</p>\n\n<h1>Option Menu </h1>\n\n<p>There are five options available for configuration, with <strong>N</strong> being the number of threads your processor supports:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong> Worker threads count</strong><br>Vanilla default N - 1, StutterFix default N - 5, is the number of threads running to perform tasks like generating chunks. The smaller the value, the less CPU overhead, reducing stuttering, and the slower the chunk generation speed.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong> Priority cutoff point</strong><br>Indicates the cutoff point for the priority of worker threads. The higher the value, the higher the first part of the threads will be with normal priority and the lower the last part will be with minimum priority. The value must be less than the number of worker threads to have the cutoff point, otherwise all threads will have normal priority. Threads with minimum priority help reduce stuttering.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong> Render thread priority</strong><br> The rendering thread is where the client runs, such as the player, sound, inputs, and rendering.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong> Server thread priority</strong><br> In singleplayer mode, the game starts the integrated server that runs the entire world, such as ticks, entities and initializing the generation of chunks (which will be executed in the worker threads).

The tooltip has been improved.</p>\n\n<p>In version 0.2.0, changes were made to the gui, to resolve compatibility issues with some mods, such as <strong>bedrockify</strong>.</p>\n\n\n<h1> Warnings</h1>\n<p>The mod does not affect the stuttering problem that occurs due to the garbage collector, I reduced the problem by using -XX:+UseShenandoahGC and allocating more memory in jvm arguments, do a search for jvm arguments for minecraft to get more information.</p>\n\n<strong>If you encounter any issues, please report the issue on <a href=\"https://github.com/wisecase2/StutterFix/issues\">Github</a>.</strong>","published":"2023-11-28T17:32:46.300202Z","updated":"2024-01-08T19:37:46.127627Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":46291,"followers":117,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["EMk9C0uc","w8AZSf95","zgGtBuGd","cLp5iRrT","hxGSuUke","JD2veGMW","GYSmfiPM","e0OEg7wG","tMkRCw5u","mhD4lahI","uIeEaGZ6","6LOQm8s0","bdXfnUUl","fFjDcvVD","UwT5Yn8f","UxHH96FR","52lnr3A3","dY770EZv","bRf0gXFJ","nXoQGQed","eNAAsBWT","l0V4QSPA","te06ZQpD","beT1zdXy","JFNunyDW","OzHup14j"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/FimwF33K/d89a1144463fa0b3b07c1ed501f8f6c90ae73185.png"},"version":{"id":"JFNunyDW","project_id":"FimwF33K","author_id":"DFDoBX0a","featured":false,"name":"StutterFix mc1.20.1-0.2.0","version_number":"mc1.20.1-0.2.0","changelog":"- Fixed compatibility issues with some mods, such as <strong>bedrockify</strong>.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-08T19:37:11.017579Z","downloads":17903,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"e5fb6570d1497cec69a5487151e2064323c8e88c9a00655b3b50a424513eb3a8f9b32a953e909dc68485b4022a1c169c57637e1cda25df75aae4fdbdd4efc71a","sha1":"663fbe94a664951e384ebfaa0b463ddd769350fe"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/FimwF33K/versions/JFNunyDW/stutterfix-mc1.20.1-0.2.0.jar","filename":"stutterfix-mc1.20.1-0.2.0.jar","primary":true,"size":26413,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"AUigtdIu","user":{"id":"DFDoBX0a","username":"wisecase2","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/DFDoBX0a/990b8fc9798e4219604587c0539e8377a1666b28.png","bio":null,"created":"2023-11-27T22:01:07.318983Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"stutterfix-mc1.20.1-0.2.0.jar"},"mods\\CorgiLib-fabric-1.20.1-4.0.1.1.jar":{"sha512":"93fc7d00deb5548186ed645816275ce356d3d990820bb326f4c76aa5487bc1b0e9c34f843d4216a42358b7207d18556acbcefabca6396709e1b040f2907feeca","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ziOp6EO8","slug":"corgilib","project_type":"mod","team":"C2nKtbZ6","title":"CorgiLib","description":"A library mod containing code used across Corgi Taco's mods.","body":"This is a mod containing code used in Corgi Taco's mods including the following helpful features:\n\n- `.json5` Config Serialization with Mojang's codecs.

This allows for much more advanced and flexible sensors\n\n<h3>Advanced behaviours</h3>\n\nUtilise built-in, or create new behaviours based on an extensible behaviour class, which builds in callbacks, predication, cooldowns, and more.\n\n<h3>Runtime-safe behaviour modification</h3>\n\nAdd, remove, and modify behaviours dynamically from an existing entity.\n\n<h3>Optimisation</h3>\n\nSBL replaces almost the entirety of the vanilla brain system's functions, using high-efficiency functions to remove the inefficiencies in as many areas as possible of the brain. Done right, an SBL entity could be even more efficient than one using goals!\n\n<h3>Additional sensors, behaviours, and memory types</h3>\n\nSBL builds in additional modules for use in any entity, with more to come over time.\n\n<h3>Added utility functions</h3>\n\nAs well as the expected brain functionality, SBL additionally adds additional helpers, such as:\n<ul>\n<li>Optimised level entity-getter functions</li>\n<li>Developer-friendly Random library</li>\n<li>Brain interface utility for adding/removing brain content from non-SBL entities</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How do I use it?</h2>\n\nThe library is documented on its <a href=\"https://github.com/Tslat/SmartBrainLib/wiki\">Wiki Page</a>\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n\nIf you have issues or want to contribute, please jump on the <a href=\"https://github.com/Tslat/SmartBrainLib/issues\">Github Page</a> and make your voice heard","published":"2022-12-17T12:17:52.593792Z","updated":"2024-04-30T04:20:20.702555Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":261753,"followers":96,"categories":["library","mobs","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["exjazZDg","71op6HqT","ysll7HpR","eO2xepQK","yg06oOBL","uvicGZEz","M7ktWGYQ","edbi1MqI","dwBqdXTr","mVxYjt2C","UV85Isda","TPUuRqId","7N07DeJa","5fHkAtan","a8k5dfeM","YtIoSE8Z","kIHNFgnN","LEkLts9l","nKzUoyO8","eyTnm1To","YuXSOitO","bLpKjCaQ","iKI7O10v","5cfIbMqV","j5XWlgk3","ItbW1raD","JI1HW5g1","l1gfkZbZ","Okj48Ibk","61jQHgGB","R8SV4kEf","diQfXwzz","TQ4ys3Av","rAWSa9XC","AzORYDU1","FH1MNWFQ","RC9fgR3J","mAriNnAC","EB0jfrC5","4XxIY1BG","F112BW8M","YJrpYN13","blvJQFdb","hww2X4x4","VgKI4whr","pcIY8pUw","QmXwJzyR","FGnzv2Lk","IBB8LO6M","Sf934AXj","6m8aUEBx","Wiuu8JU7","qNnjjZzo","QvPn3aLF","oLNiEUfG","KAMi0Ept","4p96t8Yd","zhZ3UUw6","aLYIaCqo","JJ4nopDF","rMDWa1ai","RLMA7zfB","9OZ7OJ3s","d5rNlXJS","vUPsJnRv","KtPqX3wy","mY9xu8va","oxXdjo3N"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/PuyPazRT/622163918cf3b62f4f0172962ac4205030e7074a.png"},"version":{"id":"aLYIaCqo","project_id":"PuyPazRT","author_id":"GIhCykJ9","featured":false,"name":"1.14","version_number":"1.14","changelog":"No changelog was specified.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-18T20:45:20.867695Z","downloads":13454,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"e7bfcb9d3bc48f9c6beb77a372926915ecd202fd952fe883ceb472d6de3adbf8267b04af5c7e98cadc846d8a11ad350b191fd4ba3197d7d0bebffca1a16fea41","sha1":"9d947d3d72210cf9c29066fa6f1e7c1577ebffc0"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/PuyPazRT/versions/aLYIaCqo/SmartBrainLib-fabric-1.20.1-1.14.jar","filename":"SmartBrainLib-fabric-1.20.1-1.14.jar","primary":true,"size":356063,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"DSfXxkQM","user":{"id":"GIhCykJ9","username":"Tslat","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7098525?v=4","bio":"I am person, do things.","created":"2021-07-22T02:03:12.915903Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"SmartBrainLib-fabric-1.20.1-1.14.jar"},"mods\\ranged_weapon_api-1.1.1+1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"ca722b081df25966d3739acbb8730adbee022e71241b2d6d53394458bde4f0213675d016578dbd7d9ca4fa4f25cf291a8ec088e1d9b9548b8c046e0fadc2b7c9","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"AqaIIO6D","slug":"ranged-weapon-api","project_type":"mod","team":"O5jDpEBx","title":"Ranged Weapon API","description":"🏹 Create fully functional bows and crossbows, with ease","body":"# Ranged Weapon API\n\nThis mod is an API for developers, relying on Fabric API, to allow easy bow and crossbow creation.\n\nFeatures:\n- Bows and Crossbow construction\n- Customizable weapon properties: damage, pull time, projectile velocity (optional)\n- Automatic item model predicate registration (matching vanilla model predicates)\n- Correct rendering first and third person rendering\n- Correct pull FOV\n\nRead all technical details in the GitHub readme.","published":"2024-01-14T21:32:38.145079Z","updated":"2024-04-11T11:32:39.782147Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":32412,"followers":17,"categories":["equipment","library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["RzWpA7xD","Mj5snp7k","oEjSAqNj"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AqaIIO6D/659d1ad81b30e0b9da56a64ba2c5c85645ad5fff.png"},"version":{"id":"oEjSAqNj","project_id":"AqaIIO6D","author_id":"CUHgJfv9","featured":false,"name":"1.1.1+1.20.1","version_number":"1.1.1+1.20.1","changelog":"# 1.1.1\n\nAPI Changes:\n- BREAKING!

Register any field with only a simple annotation, regardless of mod loader!</li>\n<li>Custom reimplementation of Jigsaw Manager with improved performance and custom pool element types with various new properties. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/yungnickyoung/YUNGs-Better-Dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Better Dungeons code</a> to see it in action.</li>\n<li>New criteria trigger for safely locating any structure. If the given structure doesn't exist, the trigger simply fails rather than instantly passing (unlike vanilla).</li>\n<li>Interfaces for JSON serialization &amp; deserialization&nbsp;with built-in type adapters.</li>\n<li>Simple, lightweight math utilities for vectors and column positions</li>\n<li><em>BlockStateRandomizer</em> and <em>ItemRandomizer</em>, data abstractions that make adding block and item randomization to your structures incredibly simple. I use these for all of my mods!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you're curious, you can check the code for my mods (especially the newer ones) to see how things work. Feel free to ask me any questions on Discord!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/a49IMQJ.png\" /><br />\n<a title=\"Get 25% off your server with code YUNGNICKYOUNG at Bisect Hosting!\" href=\"https://bisecthosting.com/yung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nQRs7ZP.png\" alt=\"Use code YUNGNICKYOUNG with Bisect Hosting for 25% off!\" width=\"1344\" height=\"400\" /></a></p>","published":"2022-11-28T17:17:12.676483Z","updated":"2024-05-10T02:27:58.106001Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1721022,"followers":904,"categories":["library","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["xET3UZBe","UNVzqGkX","82XBGKbQ","xvoWCwex","LYoQlbQt","YwHWUw19","LEuKu3qt","Em3G31xp","dpSzBMP6","IOIGqCVr","i0Z1vSK9","YZE1pnbT","GNNfW5IV","IxuGYnWF","yIFytswN","h32n7OPC","4Ek11kQV","NmrTF2A5","TT8tnzlH","HIRzLg0r","pxmQWPn7","L5GqhLVE","QnR5jGmc","hyQxutx9","rbgh8n1F","5Zb55w2q","k1OTLc33","sE5QMX20","RXxBbRs7","wddoDji1","dpTBMhjf","jLW564iU","a7qxhSOZ","aMs83SRk","zPT7QfIk"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Ua7DFN59/38049bae08310ffed43435f717e309b15ec6f29d.png"},"version":{"id":"zPT7QfIk","project_id":"Ua7DFN59","author_id":"HCGwycZf","featured":false,"name":"[1.20] v4.0.5 (Fabric)","version_number":"1.20-Fabric-4.0.5","changelog":"- Improved structure entity processing compatibility with other mods on Fabric  \n\nIf you want to get early access to all my mods, [Join the Patreon!](https://www.patreon.com/yungnickyoung)  \n[Join us on Discord!](https://discord.gg/rns3beq)  \n[Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/yungnickyoung) for more mod updates!","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-10T02:27:59.148100Z","downloads":65942,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"69594e17b98a440d6015b8b5131594d9104f05cfb512d2b99c6892f0e89d052e2fa30bb33e35010bc1e86211bbfce1c210488fa77500e2497d1c8ee45239cb01","sha1":"9aa99d06657779322767aafd10b9a44eed2690b6"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Ua7DFN59/versions/zPT7QfIk/YungsApi-1.20-Fabric-4.0.5.jar","filename":"YungsApi-1.20-Fabric-4.0.5.jar","primary":true,"size":1391845,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"3TidTIHz","user":{"id":"HCGwycZf","username":"YUNGNICKYOUNG","name":"Nick Young","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/HCGwycZf/f4ec4b86f9778f12367fbd3a3e9f9e6af6830bee.png","bio":"Mr. Better Minecraft","created":"2022-11-13T01:46:47.603854Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Developer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"3TidTIHz","user":{"id":"f74fCorY","username":"Drullkus","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5010174?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-12T01:48:09.113754Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"YungsApi-1.20-Fabric-4.0.5.jar"},"mods\\guardvillagers-2.0.9-1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"afdb9cac841cb48878b7ff21b9344d047a2f342ed53770ad01d25c0a2b02d33988c14edf1f0e7ca80274cbafb2f0f821571fead16703dfa6e4261c0ba6d8b169","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"59rkB3YY","slug":"guard-villagers-(fabricquilt)","project_type":"mod","team":"GPzLcjlp","title":"Guard Villagers (Fabric/Quilt)","description":"Guards that help with village pest control","body":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">This is a fabric port of Guard Villagers by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/almightytallestred/projects\">almightytallestred</a> for 1.18, get the original forge version <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/guard-villagers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a><br /></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Are you tired of your village dying off because its golem is too lazy?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Are you tired of essentially defending it all by yourself?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">This mod adds <strong>Guards</strong> as a solution, as well as new villager-related AI changes.</span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Guards&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<div class=\"spoiler\" style=\"display: block;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">These spawn in villages in groups of six, equipped with either an iron sword or a crossbow.

These essentially correspond to the vanilla regular and jigsaw structure types, but with better placement and a clearer json format.\nBoth types can choose from the following placements:\n| Identifier | Description |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| `surface` | Will place the structure at the top layer of solid blocks |\n| `ceiling` | Will place the at the bottom layer of solid blocks |\n| `on_water` | Will place the structure at the top layer of blocks if those blocks are water |\n| `on_lava` | Will place the structure at the top layer of blocks if those blocks are lava |\n| `underground` | Will place the structure somewhere between the top and bottom layers of blocks |\n| `underground_surface` | Will place the structure between the top and bottom layers of blocks, at the bottom of an open area |\n| `underground_ceiling` | Will place the structure between the top and bottom layers of blocks, at the top of an open area |\n| `underground_buried` | Will place the structure between the top and bottom layers of blocks, such that it is not exposed to any open area |\n| `underground_on_lava` | Will place the structure between the top and bottom layers of blocks, in an open area on top of lava |\n\n### Structure Pool Element Types\nFormations adds one new structure pool element type, `formations:single_pool_element`. The element type allows setting a different ground level rather than vanilla's fixed ground level of 0. The ground level can be set through the `ground_level` key.\n\n### Structure Processors\nFormations adds a bunch of new structure processors.\n| Identifier | Parameters | Description |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| `formations:random_bed_color` | - | Randomizes the color of any beds |\n| `formations:biome_replacements` | - | Replaces certain blocks, such as wood, bricks and grass, based on the biome |\n| `formations:fill_brewing_stands` | `slotFillChance`, `maxBlazePowder` | Fills brewing stands with random potions and blaze powder ` |\n| `formations:fill_chiseled_bookshelves` | `slotFillChance` | Fills chiseled bookshelves with enchanted books |\n| `formations:block_age` | `mossiness`, `degradation`, `disintegration` | Randomly replaces regular blocks with mossy or cracked variants, full blocks with slabs or stairs, random blocks with air |\n| `formations:random_plant_growth` | `minGrowth`, `maxGrowth` | Randomizes the growth stage of any crops |\n| `formations:respawn_anchor_charges` | `minCharges`, `maxCharges` | Randomizes the number of charges of any respawn anchors |\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/LqyZP68.png)\n\n## Examples\nFor examples usage of the features, you can check out [<img width='25' alt='formations overworld logo' src='https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/KX1XC0Oo/623ec34d4dbc1ca9c5aa6477f9043e86bbaa899b.webp'> Formations Overworld](https://modrinth.com/mod/formations-overworld) and [<img width='25' alt='formations nether logo' src='https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cGvQGRls/2e21f4c247ad58965c320f037c4febfa9cf827bb.webp'> \n Formations Nether](https://modrinth.com/mod/formations-nether)\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/V9cw31J.png)\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Can I use your mod in my modpack?**  \nYes, feel free to use my mod in your modpack\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/boQSGyP.png)\n\n## Discord\nFor future content, upcoming mods, and discussion, feel free to join the SuperMartijn642 discord server!

Not only do items stay inside the interface after closing, also some annoying restrictions are removed. Also name tags can be renamed without even using an anvil.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">First of all, anvils now have an <strong>Inventory</strong> for storing the items you put inside. This also means items will stay in the anvil after you close the interface. To put this functionality to good use, anvil contents will now <strong>Render</strong> as laying on top of the anvil.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvils no longer use the prior work penalty tag, so no matter how often you repair an item or add new enchantments to it, <strong>Costs Won't Needlessly Increase</strong>. You can also fully <strong>Configure The Max Level Limit</strong>, which controls when the <i>Too Expensive!</i> flag shows up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvils can now be <strong>Repaired</strong> by one stage using iron blocks. You can also use a dispenser to automate repairing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Name tags have quite a few nice changes: Not only is setting a name in an anvil <strong>Completely Free</strong> and doesn't risk damaging your precious anvil, you don't even need an anvil at all anymore to change a name tag's name. Simply shift + right-click a name tag to <strong>Open A Simple Interface</strong> for setting a new name.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Text Can Be Stylized</strong> using Minecraft's native formatting codes in both the anvil and name tag interface. This allows for setting custom colors and styles when choosing item and entity names. Check the <a href=\"https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes#Usage\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Minecraft Wiki</strong></span></a> for more information on formatting codes.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/27/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/28/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Anvils can be so fancy!</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Free name tag renames</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/29/2022-09-29_09.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/30/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>No max level limit anymore</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>No anvil required for renaming name tags anymore</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/422/2022-10-04_21.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/424/2022-10-04_21.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Repair anvils by one stage using iron blocks</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Use formatting codes when naming your equipment</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I want enchanting tables to keep and render their contents as well!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sure thing, check out my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/easy-magic\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Easy Magic</span></a> mod which does just that and more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Forge on versions of Minecraft before 1.17?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Check out the mods which inspired this project: <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/anvil-tweaks\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvil Tweaks</span></a>, <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/anvil-repair\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvil Repair</span></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nametags-without-anvils\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Nametags Without Anvils</span></a> by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/tfarecnim\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>tfarecnim</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Mods can have three different kinds of configs depending on the kind of settings they provide: <strong>Client</strong>, <strong>Common</strong>, and <strong>Server</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Client</strong> and <strong>Common</strong> configs are found in <code>/.minecraft/config/</code>, named as <code>&lt;modId&gt;-client.toml</code> and <code>&lt;modId&gt;-common.toml</code>, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Server</strong> configs though are applied per world, therefore you'll find those in <code>/.minecraft/saves/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for local singeplayer worlds, and in <code>/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for you Minecraft server. Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod for editing configs directly in-game.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:

If player doesn't kill any mob within time, the rage is lost.\n*   A kill counter appears on the right side of the hotbar. Default max kill count is 20 (Configurable) and if player reaches the limit, damaging enemies will burn them for 2 seconds.\n*   Default damage bonus of 0.5 (Configurable) is added every 4 (Configurable) kills in a streak. **It means that streak of 20 kills will grant player additional 2.5 damage points per hit during rage**.\n*   If rage is enabled, flame particles will spawn around player every few seconds. The overlay can be disabled in config.\n\nFeel free to post your suggestions about new features in mod!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tX1BGKb.png)\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/np93li4.png)](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=102)\n\n***\n\n[<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/D2NwqWB.gif\" alt=\"tb banner\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"/>](https://modrinth.com/mod/travelersbackpack)[<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kKBvbr7.png\" alt=\"pizzacraft banner\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"/>](https://modrinth.com/mod/pizzacraft)[<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9euilOy.png\" alt=\"cloud boots banner\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"/>](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloud-boots)","published":"2023-03-20T19:27:10.523063Z","updated":"2024-05-07T12:57:14.832201Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":57090,"followers":54,"categories":["game-mechanics","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["VWCfHPjL","NWvTVZUx","maBbTSYH","kfYrNGOM","WVbfx6UX","ZXs1JjIl","D9tU4cc6","TIUz7BWG","D0n4MRgR","uYPK5LNR","N1inzGEr","20uHqGM4","GJGm8bqe","v9uvp9hF","6cjyMQPg","X0z9UBh0","ny7BpBp4","fUiA12Qa","pHPv8ehp","oacLZCFC","7x0xA8ZJ","1pPxukir","eRuSJr7f","9e7lrZQh"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1BGsoydA/7b8486486a292d19ebaa4ec8f593d7702f681406.png"},"version":{"id":"1pPxukir","project_id":"1BGsoydA","author_id":"ARCVguWR","featured":false,"name":"[1.20.1] Warrior Rage 1.0.1","version_number":"1.20.1-1.0.1","changelog":"✨ Added integration with Mod menu config screen  \n✨ Added syncing config on server  \n🐛 Fixed bugs  \n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-07T12:54:22.401156Z","downloads":1013,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"fc07b2da6329a29d69a38aaf36493d2451d376f08412773f9b330946072884fc83d0c798fb8e24864ff1c42d897c7f03bbaa2e6725b48fe4fbff7222b47c578e","sha1":"923b78ff5f07063dba098fdc6e3d912f7963f94d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1BGsoydA/versions/1pPxukir/warriorrage-fabric-1.20.1-1.0.1.jar","filename":"warriorrage-fabric-1.20.1-1.0.1.jar","primary":true,"size":73680,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"K01OU20C","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"CKWrS56g","user":{"id":"ARCVguWR","username":"Tiviacz1337","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34790800?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-06-11T08:13:48.718411Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"warriorrage-fabric-1.20.1-1.0.1.jar"},"mods\\gravity-changer-1.1.2+mc1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"d73d104ee2bca052ec76e151433d80884cd42fd6faab7160f69d6b78e4826ece3b9c4d18651f9007ede4330e1615f140dd0a3b8d022562ffb994252dafce9632","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"bqOyYdKi","slug":"gravity-api-fork","project_type":"mod","team":"6tEPSJRd","title":"Gravity Changer (qouteall fork)","description":"Change gravity direction","body":"Provides gravity changing functionality and API.\n\n**Note: this mod is based on but different to Gravity API by Fusion Flux.** This is a fork of [Gravity API from Fusion Flux](https://modrinth.com/mod/gravity-api) that is on Fabric (Immersive Portals mod depends on gravity changing mod but a Fabric mod cannot depend on a Quilt mod). The Gravity API mod is originally based on the Gravity Changer mod by Gaider10.\n\nThe latest version of this mod provides:\n* Gravity effects and potions\n* Gravity anchor\n* Gravity plate that generates gravity field. Its effect range can be customized.\n\n\nThese things are not obtainable on normal survival.\n\nSome code and resources come from [AmethystGravity mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/amethyst-gravity).\n\nNote: the version 0.9.0 is incompatible with Quilt.\n\n### Commands\n\nThis mod's commands are different to Gravity API's. These are the commands in the latest version of this mod:\n\n`/gravity set_base_direction <direction> [entities]` sets the base gravity direction. (The base direction can be overridden by other things including effects, gravity anchor and gravity plating). Without `[entities]` argument it will target the command sender (the same applies to all commands). Examples: `/gravity set_base_direction up`   `/gravity set_base_direction up @e[type=!minecraft:player]`\n\n`/gravity set_base_strength <strength> [entities]` sets the base gravity strength. The strength effects will multiply on the base strength (instead of overriding it). Examples: `/gravity set_base_strength 0.5`  `/gravity set_base_strength 0.5 @e`\n\n`/gravity view` shows the base gravity direction and strength of the command sender.\n\n`/gravity reset [entities]` reset the base gravity direction and strength. \n\n`/gravity randomize_base_direction [entities]` sets the base direction as a random direction.\n\n`/gravity set_relative_base_direction <relativeDirection> [entities]` sets the gravity direction as a direction relative to the entity's viewing direction. The `<relativeDirection>` can be `forward`, `backward`, `left`, `right`, `up` or `down`.\n\n`/gravity set_dimension_gravity_strength <strength>` sets the dimensional gravity strength for the current dimension. \n\n`/gravity view_dimension_info` shows the dimensional gravity strength for the current dimension.\n\n","published":"2023-06-10T06:48:24.939194Z","updated":"2024-01-21T01:32:46.204434Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":20210,"followers":52,"categories":["game-mechanics","library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["ElaDXNBf","nZM5c9D8","MwMTmzeK","oLXip6OU","cyn8O2P3","kl3DxAl9","vXzWoQMM","lSIHsBj5","4WLvZoDm"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/bqOyYdKi/0c753151efa14fb0d3007a7c286687b491eddc23.webp"},"version":{"id":"kl3DxAl9","project_id":"bqOyYdKi","author_id":"EMYx6kL8","featured":false,"name":"v1.1.2-mc1.20.1","version_number":"v1.1.2-mc1.20.1","changelog":"Fix https://github.com/qouteall/GravityChanger/issues/17","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-13T13:53:24.259819Z","downloads":11951,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"a54d63fa622c3ab9b37d1a97406f60a1bab6ef22","sha512":"d73d104ee2bca052ec76e151433d80884cd42fd6faab7160f69d6b78e4826ece3b9c4d18651f9007ede4330e1615f140dd0a3b8d022562ffb994252dafce9632"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/bqOyYdKi/versions/kl3DxAl9/gravity-changer-1.1.2%2Bmc1.20.1.jar","filename":"gravity-changer-1.1.2+mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":420985,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"6tEPSJRd","user":{"id":"EMYx6kL8","username":"qouteall","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45908579?v=4","bio":"...","created":"2021-04-10T03:26:20.525390Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"gravity-changer-1.1.2+mc1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\morearmortrims-1.2.0.jar":{"sha512":"b7abc137709f8b964a6740db84a17a4e6018f9585bb621c8f982cbb965c27114fd26608eb344a7153a1c84c1e9547904856a64e8fde7d80e80fe22ec51acadff","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"FGNYBAJ6","slug":"more-armor-trims","project_type":"mod","team":"dsoIajMY","title":"More Armor Trims","description":"🎨 Adds ten new armor trims.","body":"![Title](https://imgur.com/uG4WJHv.png)\nIf you thought that there could be more armor trims in Minecraft, you are just like me!

href=\"https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immediatelyfast\"><img src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_686911_downloads.svg\"></a>\n\n  <p>ImmediatelyFast is an open source Minecraft mod which improves the immediate mode rendering performance of the client.\n  <br />It is designed to be lightweight and compatible with other mods.</p>\n</div>\n\n## Optimizations\nImmediatelyFast generally optimizes all immediate mode rendering by using a custom buffer implementation which batches\ndraw calls and uploads data to the GPU in a more efficient way.  \nThe following parts of the immediate mode rendering code are optimized:\n\n- Entities\n- Block entities\n- Particles\n- Text rendering\n- GUI/HUD\n- Immediate mode rendering of other mods\n\nIt also features targeted optimizations where vanilla rendering code is being changed in order to run faster.  \nThe following parts of the rendering code are optimized with a more efficient implementation:\n\n- Map rendering\n- HUD rendering\n- Text rendering\n\n## Performance\nHere are some performance comparisons of areas the mod optimizes particularly well:\n\nIf other mods are listed in the table this means that this mod also optimizes that part of the game.\n\nTest Hardware: Ryzen 5 1600, 32GB DDR4, GTX 1060\n\nFPS Numbers were taken from external tools (in this case MSI Afterburner) and averaged over a couple of seconds.  \nIf you decide to test this yourself keep in mind that ImmediatelyFast can only improve FPS in a scenario where your CPU\nis the bottleneck (Most likely the case if your GPU isn't ancient or you use very heavy shaders).\nSlower CPUs will benefit more from this mod than really fast CPUs.\n\n### Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** on busy servers. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 1000 cows in a 3x3 box on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 16 FPS                  | 60 FPS               | 3.75x       |\n| Sodium          | 21 FPS                  | 82 FPS               | 3.90x       |\n| Iris and Sodium | 60 FPS                  | 76 FPS               | 1.27x       |\n\n### Map Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **5x higher** when there are many maps on screen. [Tested using IF 1.1.1 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a fabric server with the [Image2Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/image2map) mod and around 930 maps on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 50 FPS                  | 310 FPS              | 6.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 47 FPS                  | 320 FPS              | 6.81x       |\n\n### HUD Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **40% higher** in almost all scenarios. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with different HUD elements on screen (Scoreboard, Potion effect overlay, Bossbars, Filled Chat, Extra hearts, Full Hotbar)._\n\n| Other mods          | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None                | 250 FPS                 | 380 FPS              | 1.52x       |\n| Sodium              | 335 FPS                 | 630 FPS              | 1.88x       |\n| Exordium and Sodium | 740 FPS                 | 840 FPS              | 1.14x       |\n\n### Text Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** when there are many signs or holograms around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 200 signs (Filled with text) on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 70 FPS                  | 125 FPS              | 1.79x       |\n| Sodium          | 110 FPS                 | 300 FPS              | 2.73x       |\n\n### Block-Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **20% higher** when there are many block entities around you.

Features\n\n[![Enviroment](https://img.shields.io/badge/Enviroment-Client-purple)](https://modrinth.com/mods?e=client)\n[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/950942125225283634?color=blue&logo=discord&label=Discord)](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz)\n\n[![Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/traben)\n\n## 🤔 What does this mod do?\n\nETF is a Fabric (Quilt compatible) & Forge mod that adds many new _Entity Texture Features_, including entity and player skin features!\nThis way, ETF achieves more OptiFine parity on the Fabric mod loader. If you want more OptiFine features on Fabric, you can either check [this list](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives), made by LambdaAurora, **or** you can use the [Fabulously Optimized modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), which includes **all** the OptiFine parity mods!\n\n### Featuring:\n\n- [🎲](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/RANDOM_GUIDE.md) Custom & random entity textures with the OptiFine format, including even more properties!\n- [💡](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/EMISSIVE_GUIDE.md) Emissive/glowing entity textures with the OptiFine format\n- [😑️](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README.md#-blinking-textures) Blinking mobs\n- [🎨](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/SKIN_GUIDE.md) Player skin features\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- OptiFine's random/custom or emissive entity resource packs - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatable**\n- [Entity Model Features (EMF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [dorianpb's CEM mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\">  **Fully compatible**\n- [Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**<br />(Support varies depending on the shader)\n- Mod added entities - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Compatible**<br />(Only if the mod creator used the vanilla rendering code to render their mobs)\n\n## Settings & configuration\n\n- Settings can be changed in-game using [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), the settings button in the resource pack screen, or  by editing the config file, located under `config/entity_texture_features.json`\n- A few of these options can also be changed via the [Puzzle mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzle)\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/raw/master/.github/README-assets/options.png\" alt=\"Options\" width=\"450\">\n\n## Mod support\n\n- This mod should be compatible with any mod added entities as long as they extend `LivingEntityRenderer` class for rendering and utilise it correctly\n- Any mod displaying an entity in a custom GUI can force the default texture by having the `entity.getblockstate` set to either `null` or of type `VOID_AIR`, the same can be achieved by settings the display mob's UUID to `UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes((\"GENERIC\").getBytes())`. \n\n## FAQ\n\n My entities are invisible/broken!\n\n> Custom Entity Models is not a feature provided by ETF. If your entities are invisible or look corrupted you'll need to instal my other mod [Entity Model Features EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) as well (this includes resource packs such as Fresh Animations). Keep in mind that the CEM mod is still in alpha development and may still occur issues.\n\n Blocks and items are not emissive!\n\n> ETF does not support emissive block and item texture, for that you'll need to install [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity).\n\n My game is lagging, help!\n\n> If you are experiencing lag please check your most recent log file to see if any errors are being logged, sometimes an incorrectly written properties file or missing textures may lag the system.\n\n It doesn't work!\n\n> Check if any issues are not actually a problem in the properties file, a few packs seem to be pointing to a texture that doesn't exist.\n So far all mob entities support random & emissive textures, but there may still be some quirks. If you find bugs you can either [report them in GitHub](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/issues/new?assignees=Traben-0&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+%22short+issue+description%22) or get support in the Discord server (linked on the top of the page).\n\n> Emissives are broken with Complimentary shaders, what do I do?\n\n>Complementary shaders has its own in-built emissive textures that usually work fine but will conflict with some resource packs. You can either disable Complimentary's emissives or ETF's emissives to fix this.\n\n My question isn't here!\n\n> Feel free to check ETF's [Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz) to ask your questions or check the FAQ there :)\n\n## Change log\n\n [Changelog](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/common/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU

Some newer features might be unavailable if you use older Minecraft versions (1.16, 1.17).**  \n**⚠️ This mod is exclusive to Fabric. There is/will be no Forge version. Take a look at the FAQ below for an alternative.**\n\n## ❤ Description ❤\n\n***Stendhal*** is a ***client-side Fabric mod*** offering new and enhanced visual utilities for books, signs, anvil and the in-game chat.\n\nAll the vanilla GUIs (screens) for ***Book & Quills, Books, Anvils and Signs*** have been reworked, with ***quick access*** to various tools (import & export books and signs to/from disk, copy entire page content, entire books or signs, clear a page or a book entirely in one click, ...), legacy colors and one-click away unicode characters!\n\nOn top of that, it also offers a quick access bar for ***unicode characters when opening the chat***! You can also ***customize your nametags*** with these beautiful vanilla unicodes ***in any Anvil***!\n***Impress your friends*** by using these unicode characters while talking to them, or give directions on signs in a ***beautiful way***!\n\n## ❤ Features ❤\n\n### Configuration options\n\n- Available in many languages thanks to the community! Contribute to your language on [my Discord Community]!\n- Access the detailed configuration file under .minecraft/.config/stendhal/stendhal.properties to change any option related to the mod\n\n### Book Editor\n\n- (1.18) A Unicode (emote) picker to select any unicode supported by the in-game font!\n- (1.18) Reading a signed book is now easier with page index navigation and search features. You can also export them to use their content in a Book & Quill again!\n- (1.17) Import and Export books to the Minecraft folder to load your books on other worlds or servers!\n- Copy, paste and clear page content in writable books\n- Add and remove pages in one click\n- Copy, paste and clear an entire book\n- Choose among all the formatting and legacy colors options to customize your book\n- Keep track of how many characters you typed on the bottom of each page to not go over the vanilla 256 characters limitation\n- Add 70+ unicode characters to enhance your readers experience!\n- Unsatisfied? Remove the page formatting in one click and start again!\n\n### Sign Editor\n\n- (1.18) Import and Export signs to the Minecraft folder to load your books on other worlds or servers!\n- (1.17) Quickly copy and paste entire signs on the same world/server is now a two-click process!\n- Use 70+ unicode characters to customize your signs\n- Unsatisfied with what you wrote? Clear the sign in one click and start writing again!\n\n### Chat & Anvil Utilities\n\n- Use 70+ unicode characters to talk to your friends in a more lively way, or with customized item names!\n\n<details>\n<summary>❤ FAQ ❤</summary>\n\nQ: Does this mod allow anyone that did not install Stendhal to see the books and signs modified with it?  \nA: Yes! This mod is entirely client-side, meaning anyone with or without the mod will see the modifications done by it. It only takes advantages of hidden vanilla features and exposes them to the users without doing any breaking changes.\n\nQ: Can I use your mod in/for my modpack/datapack?  \nA: Please do! A credit would be appreciated in your modlist.  \nSimply do not appropriate yourself this mod.\n\nQ: Will this mod ever come to Forge?  \nA: No! This mod is intended to push a little forward the Fabric community, and this is my choice to explicitly not make it available to another mod loader for the time being.  \nHowever, [Ghostwriter](https://github.com/waffle-stomper/Ghostwriter) is a solid alternative for Forge and the book editing part.\n\nQ: Where can I find the source code of the project?  \nA: As of now, nowhere. This project has been a precious opportunity to make myself comfortable again with Java and a good learning process for modding, as much as I would love some help and see how people could contribute in amazing ways, I still want to practice and learn more for future mods.  \nI don't exclude opening the source code later down the line!\n\nQ: Why is your mod named \"Stendhal\"?  \nA: Glad you are wondering! Marie-Henri Stendhal was a renowned French writer born in the 19th century in my hometown in France.\n</details>\n\n## ❤ Upcoming Updates ❤\n\nStendhal is being actively developed and ported to newer Minecraft versions over time.\n\n> **If you would like to give suggestion and follow the development more actively, please join [my Discord Community]**\n\n## ❤ Community ❤\n\nYou can join me on [my Discord Community] to discuss about Stendhal alongside my various projects, whether they are linked to Minecraft modding or not!\n\nIf you would like, feel free to support me on [Ko-Fi], it would make me really happy and motivated!\n\n[![Support me on Ko-Fi!](https://cdn.ko-fi.com/cdn/kofi2.png?v=2)][Ko-Fi]\n\n[my Discord Community]: https://discord.gg/6StChT5m2V\n[Ko-Fi]: https://ko-fi.com/nebspacefarer\n","published":"2021-04-03T13:00:28.570722Z","updated":"2024-05-12T17:20:25.081246Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":900236,"followers":647,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["7RZcMviG","6HUcDuYC","FgDI6kIz","ZBI5qTep","tzYc9HNM","mctIoo5p","GegFEZ3h","cSzSbcvJ","FPGndHr3","YzKB2i5W","MAruo7Ba","DRpka5gO","5OcCVJdV","YYMS9LcJ","WEzwowSz","fAaHFHVp","NriKkvat","LUHS9aJ0","apwqGSaK","Vf7GPVNV","XBrcSt3S","Uj1peBrG","GPeTJmd2","RP6Tr3Bo"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BWloQ9jK/5038b0062081cc4af94eb4dcfdcd2615fa6cbf2f.png"},"version":{"id":"Uj1peBrG","project_id":"BWloQ9jK","author_id":"TXl4HOmY","featured":true,"name":"Stendhal 1.4.1 -

It doesn't require all players to have the mod, but in that case they won't see the trims/dyes/etc.\n\nYou can *technically* obtain a trimmed/dyed elytra on a server without the mod. To do it create an elytra you want in creative singleplayer, save it in a hotbar and load on the server.\n\n## Trims\n\nPut any trim on your elytra just like any other armor. Mod provides a default resourcepack with all vanilla trims, but\nit can be expanded further.\n\n![A few trims](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XpzGz7KD/images/2966103eb5efb4e408088dbd502da364babf636d.png)\n\n## Banner patterns\n\nCombine your elytra with a banner to add intricate patterns and designs to your elytra.\n\n![Elytra with banner patterns](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XpzGz7KD/images/0327378aa65018c5f4e761c09c14fa94bb7e1d8d.png)\n\n## Dyeing\n\nIf you fancy something simplistic, dye your elytra however you want in a crafting table.\n\n![Dyed elytra](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XpzGz7KD/images/511e985762a518992f2bc140b34e9f5c104ade74.png)\n\n## Glowing\n\nCraft your elytra with a glow ink sac to make it glow in the dark.\n\n![Glowing trim](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XpzGz7KD/images/849d54736e4519df78678bf00a2077a528e866ad.png)\n\n## Mod compatibility\nThis lists mods Elytra Trims has explicit support for or known to work with. \nIt's likely to work with other mods, but you'll have to try it out.\n\n### Supports\n- Custom elytras:\n  - [Mythic Metals](https://modrinth.com/mod/mythicmetals)\n  - [Better End](https://modrinth.com/mod/betterend)\n  - [Mekanism](https://modrinth.com/mod/mekanism)\n- Extra trim patterns (Requires [Extensions](https://modrinth.com/mod/elytra-trims-extensions): \n  - [More Armor Trims](https://modrinth.com/mod/more-armor-trims)\n  - [Geode+](https://modrinth.com/mod/geode-plus)\n  - [Frostiful](https://modrinth.com/mod/frostiful)\n  - [Ancient Aether](https://modrinth.com/mod/ancient-aether)\n  - [Alex's Caves](https://modrinth.com/mod/alexs-caves)\n- Elytra trinkets:\n  - [Elytra Slot](https://modrinth.com/mod/elytra-slot)\n  - [Elytra Trinket](https://modrinth.com/mod/elytra_trinket)\n- Trim utilities:\n  - [All The Trims](https://modrinth.com/mod/allthetrims)\n  - [Better Trims](https://modrinth.com/mod/bettertrims)\n  - [Better Enchanting Table](https://modrinth.com/mod/bettersmithingtable)\n- Extra banners:\n  - [Additional Banners](https://modrinth.com/mod/additional-banners)\n  - [Archeology Banners](https://modrinth.com/mod/archaeology-banners)\n  - *And any other banner mods*\n\n### Conflicts\n- [Customizable Elytra](<https://modrinth.com/mod/customizable-elytra>) - overrides elytra renderer entirely, preventing Elytra Trims from working.\n\n## Customization\n\nWith resourcepack support, you can customize all the mod's features to your liking. Change the texture of your armor\ntrims or add a unique design to your elytra pattern with ease.\n\n## FAQ\n(Elytra Trims will be referred as ET)\n> I can't put trims/banner/dyes on the elytra!\n- If you're playing on a server, ET has to be installed there. On a paper/purpur/spigot or vanilla server you can use the datapack, but it will only work for trims.\n  If you're playing in singleplayer, it means ET is not loaded. Look up on YouTube how to install mods.\n\n> How do I use this mod on a server without it?\n- Client-side commands are planned, however for now the easiest way is to save trimmed elytra in a creative hotbar and load it on a server.  \n  Survival recipes are not possible without the mod installed on the server.\n\n> How can I remove trims/patterns/dye/glow from my elytra?\n- To remove patterns, dye and glow (all together), click with elytra on a cauldrow with water.  \nTrims can't be removed without other mods due to vanilla parity.\n\n> Trims look bad with capes!\n- Install [Mod Menu](<https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu>) and [YACL](<https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl>). In the mods tab find ET and open its settings. There you can disable rendering elytra capes. This is preferable to the vanilla cape setting because it will keep the cape while not wearing an elytra.\n\n## Roadmap\n- [x] Elytra trims (v1.0)\n- [x] Dyes and banners (v1.1.0)\n- [x]

It includes two built-in resource packs - one provides default connected textures, similar to Optifine, and the other provides a fix for glass pane culling.\n\n## Forge Version\n\nA Forge version of Continuity will not be made for the following reasons.\n\n- Forge's model API: It is vastly different from Fabric's model API (FRAPI), which is readily utilized by Continuity, and switching to it would not only require an incredible amount of effort, but also result in the mod being extremely inefficient.\n- Optifine: It has native support for Forge and provides the same features as Continuity.\n\n### Links\n\n[CurseForge Page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/continuity)\n","published":"2021-09-25T20:27:10.714654Z","updated":"2024-05-15T05:16:05.016498Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":3778950,"followers":4832,"categories":["decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["Xn8QzMB9","6JEV45oM","i0ccQghD","27YRAXEt","SffGs8Ro","yiOF0F2t","sD3iTKbB","gOxkykhO","Bl7pOAQf","zcqSiVI3","jjpzIZoY","xTtULC68","YEKdScFW","Ql3Ho9eR","4h5IIa7B","ImUFj5Gl","G2qoxVmV","OOpbpU2z","xy2co4Rh","JYaO3lPe","Z9FJWLMt","JXhQlDZl","Fc7h8MWD","MfBeYvQa","84Zs6tNo","Ox1racg8","hI13Vg85"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1IjD5062/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"84Zs6tNo","project_id":"1IjD5062","author_id":"CdcF3lqY","featured":false,"name":"3.0.0-beta.5+1.20.1","version_number":"3.0.0-beta.5+1.20.1","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-15T05:15:11.429367Z","downloads":78789,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"8996e74dfe96ee845bdd25e2fc5ec73a73073b2b7945693a6058182a19fd8486c4d7f03de87a3369fb73a912411b8f9061a93f0fef77c4d729157de2f31e96be","sha1":"15ad75d51f567c69308b91223454bacfd2eda7a5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1IjD5062/versions/84Zs6tNo/continuity-3.0.0-beta.5%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"continuity-3.0.0-beta.5+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":1009252,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"uoI5LZgV","user":{"id":"CdcF3lqY","username":"PepperCode1","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/CdcF3lqY/24a325b36c3ce10dbc1a86cc68c5eeb212784b63.png","bio":"","created":"2021-09-25T20:18:09.628691Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"continuity-3.0.0-beta.5+1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\Nimble-1.20.1-fabric-5.0.1.jar":{"sha512":"9093c4a9aa38764db3aca9b7aa48295e2e728f1a5b7e1db39ed98670dca58f8915f7d97d73ba621d8ce3de6b55eef840aa087540dc489a5719b5d7a6919c07f1","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Q5UvqqQd","slug":"nimble","project_type":"mod","team":"uyEAjeKk","title":"Nimble","description":"Perspective animation · Auto third person · Elytra camera roll","body":"# Nimble\n\nNimble is a simple mod that adds smooth transition animation on player perspective changes.

your screen.\nTalking players will be outlined.\nYou can disable these icons by pressing the third button from the left.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZVSfBms.png)\n\nPlayers that are not in a group will see a group icon next to your head, indicating that they can't talk to you.\n\nYou can invite players to your group chat by entering the command `/voicechat invite <playername>`.\n\n### Settings\n\nYou can access the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key and pressing the settings button.\n\nThis menu offers the ability to change the general voice chat volume and your microphone amplification.\nIn addition, there is the possibility to specify the recording and playback device.\n\nBy clicking the 'Enable microphone testing' button, you can hear your own voice and adjust the activation level of the voice activation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TMyfSYU.png)\n\n## Important Notes\n\nYou need to open a port on the server. This is port `24454` `UDP` by default.\nWithout opening this port, the voice chat will not work.\nThis port can be changed in the server config.\nMore information [here](https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/wiki/setup).\n\nThe voice chat is encrypted, but we don't guarantee the security of it. Use at your own

The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**: **It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it. ([citation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206530322-3ae46008-5356-468e-9a73-63b859364d4e.png))\n- **[SpruceUI](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI)**: **It isn't designed for configuration.** In this essence the design feels cluttered. Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**: **It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**: **It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:\n\n- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.\n- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.\n\n## Usage\n\n[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<center><div

included via Jar-in-Jar to allow it to be removed from `fabric.mod.json`, which was causing issues in developement environments when Night Config wasn't retrieved from the official Maven, but instead production jars were used, e.g. from the Curse Maven\n- Note that Night Config is shaded without being relocated to a different package, which is necessary to stay consistent with Forge\n### Removed\n- Removed deprecated classes in `net.minecraftforge.api` package\n\n[Keep a Changelog]:

[Website.](https://tr7zw.github.io/project/entityculling/)\n\nMinecraft skips rendering things that are behind you, so why is it rendering everything that you still can't see because of a wall in the way? This mod utilizes your other CPU cores/threads to do really quick path-tracing from your camera to all block/-entities to determine rather they are visible or not. During the rendering, the not visible ones will be skipped the same way entities behind you are.\n\n[![Shockbyte](https://tr7zw.dev/img/shockbyte_black.png?v=2)](https://shockbyte.com/partner/tr7zw)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- none\n\n## Incompatible\n\n- none (With some mods you might need to add the blocks to the config whitelist to fix visual issues)\n\n## Tested with\n\n- Sodium\n- Iris\n- Optifine\n \n## Note to why it works even with Sodium/Optifine\n\nThis has been tested with other mods, Optifine(Optifabric), Iris, and Sodium, in all cases resulting in fps gains in places like Game Server lobbies.\n\nYou might wonder why it does increase the FPS with Sodium since Sodium has \"Use Entity Culling\" in its Advanced settings and enabled by default. The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2024-05-25T20:34:39.856745Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":6737258,"followers":5059,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.7.10","1.8.8","1.8.9","1.12.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc","1MBmcSf1","LwvhfrTE","tUVHg6HN","pVb6ajsR","DkksI437","KSu61vcB","Ek0VIX9q","mBYyh1qv","HSirwtwV","2I1m95aJ","M5k1QJL1","knltv3Vh","iC2A1KnJ","McVB9vXT","7JR5qJ8f","dmSSEQmZ","l1SLPhB6","bpznplxY","sXviAk4G","SLiFyIon","bketoxVs","frGGaFrx","gO8hxcyv","ugIRhLoi","2LyjkgAv","PG8gMKcT","4Nq7hEtl","hyejM5za","SzEdoick","UHcskdEO","92bPVm5F"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"BDwHAdWc","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":true,"name":"1.6.2-1.20.2 - Fabric","version_number":"1.6.2-1.20.2","changelog":"## What's Changed\r\n* Update to 1.20.2\r\n* Create fr_fr.json by @Calvineries in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/119\r\n* Create vi_vn.json by @ImVietnam in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/118\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @Calvineries made their first contribution in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/119\r\n* @ImVietnam made their first contribution in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/118\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/compare/1.6.2-1.20...1.6.2-1.20.2","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-22T17:08:01.300588Z","downloads":1903505,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"8e4be2bb9703deddb3d3d212c812cdc1f9de072b","sha512":"0080d3733f77e6b2e80e40d5d7bfe63dd125d94984bf92568d3434ff281f68123ec382ee53eba021278c01059299c12492dd518e61de1247f5cf7e8040bc98f1"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/versions/BDwHAdWc/entityculling-fabric-1.6.2-mc1.20.1.jar","filename":"entityculling-fabric-1.6.2-mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":59348,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hLPrl6Gq","user":{"id":"poie5Iwy","username":"vicisacat","name":"vicisacat","avatar_url":null,"bio":"I made the Entity Culling port for beta 1.7.3 and that's it.

No longer will they pick the first seed they have but they'll try to replant what they just harvested instead\n- If no crop is being replanted farmers will choose a new crop to plant based on the crops around it. No more lone single patches of carrots n your wheat field!\n- Accept and pick up seeds from said crops & prevent non farmers from doing the same\n- Will equip a hoe while performing their farm task. Its tier depends on their villager level\n- No longer trample farmland\n- Can plant and replant on non non vanilla farmland like blocks, tweaked via a \"farmer_plantable_on\" tag. By default includes blocks like Supplementaries' planter\n- Can harvest special non crop like blocks, tweaked via a \"crop_replaceable\" tag. By default includes stuff like Immersive Weathering's weeds and Overweight Farming and Hefty crops big crop blocks\n- Are immune to sweet berry bush damage\n- In addition all villagers will now accept and breed with any (modded) food item you throw at them\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

Project Overview\n\nA classic Grappling Hook mod with great physics and a wide range of customizations! This Minecraft mod is written for\nthe Fabric & Quilt mod loaders for modern versions of Minecraft (1.18.2+) - Changes tend to focus on making it more\nextendable, as well as improving compatibility with other mods. Improvements to older features are also being sprinkled\nin from time to time.\n\nThis mod's official project pages can be found below:\n\n- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/grappling-hook-mod-fabric)\n- [CurseForge](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/grappling-hook-restitched) \n\nFabric compatibility *comes first* due to its current adoption in the Minecraft Modding community, however Quilt is\nsupported by the mod currently! In the case that either Mod Loader encounters a problem, make sure to\n[submit a bug report!](https://github.com/squeeglii/grapplemod-restitched)\n\n\n\n## 🔗 Origins\n\nThis repository is an unofficial fork of Yyon's [Grappling Hook Mod](https://github.com/yyon/grapplemod), which was \nwritten to support the Forge mod loader. It has a history stretching back all the way to its MCreator roots in 2015,\nimplementing improved physics, upgrades, and better integrations since.\n\nYou can find the links to its official project pages (and the downloads) here:\n\n- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/grappling-hook-mod/versions)\n- [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/grappling-hook-mod) (More up-to-date? Last checked 19/6/23)\n\nThis fork's root stems from the 1.19.2 version of v13, created under the original scope of providing an alternative\nunder the Fabric & Quilt ecosystems, as well as updating these ports to future versions. With the original scope met,\nfuture versions now focus on enhancements on top of the original work, as well as perpetual support into the future.\n\n\n## ☎️ Contact\n\n- **Discord:** [Support Server or](https://discord.gg/94c45XagEH) @CG360\n- **GitHub:** [/squeeglii](https://github.com/squeeglii)\n\n\n## 📜 Credits:\n\nSee [ATTRIBUTIONS.md](/ATTRIBUTIONS.md) for credits with attached licenses, such as for sounds and code.\nThere are some smaller credits also found on [the original Forge repository!](https://github.com/yyon/grapplemod/)\nwhich have been omitted here.\n\n### Technical Contributions\n\n- **Original Mod** - Yyon\n- **Textures** - Mayesnake\n- **Forge 1.18+** - Nyfaria\n- **Fabric/Quilt 1.18.2+** - CG360\n\n### Translations\n\n- **Russian** - Blueberryy\n- **French** - Neerwan\n- **Brazilian Portuguese** - Eufranio\n\n\n\n\n--- \n\n# Contributing\n\nPull Requests and Issues are always welcome!

It boasts wide compatibility with the Fabric mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is a Fabric mod, which means it requires the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed Fabric Loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) (for MC 1.15+) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) (for MC <1.19), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n<h1 id=\"hardware-compatibility\">✅ Hardware Compatibility</h1>\n\nWe only support graphics cards which have up-to-date drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.6. Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jellysquid3/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues. Make sure you include information about the mods you are using, and attach any crash/log files you have.\n\n# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWe have a short wiki with some of the most frequently asked questions [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/caffeine-meta/wiki/FAQ). More likely than not, your question already has an answer here.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.  ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/6b0e58705156ba67a6d97a74b9f9ac05da69f502.webp))\n\n- Smooth lighting now works correctly on fluids and other special blocks ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/d84313e6f57dc9e7896961dbd2dfc2689d482758.webp)) We also fix a number of graphical issues with block shading ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/56c4599efcb529a19aed0e118caad4178d7fd540.webp)) which helps to make everything look smoother.","published":"2021-01-03T00:53:34.185936Z","updated":"2024-04-29T16:00:45.150007Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":11069692,"followers":13422,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["yaoBL9D9","YAGZ1cCS","1b0GhKHj","80jYkEVr","xuWxRZPd","3JJvf9Kn","6YGRDUVT","Fz37KqRh","5JyduDNN","74Y5Z8fo","Yp8wLY1P","F79MzDJD","rAfhHfow","mnEhtGuH","Nr39FOaS","ObtU68vj","oYfJQ6lR","idtcaIVT","b4hTi3mo","vgceLbdH","hiO9bwqc","OkwCNtFH","6SSPmLc9","4OZL6q9h","bbP1qBMr","lhZYeXLf","zPwAvKCF","InGKdfel","pmgeU5yX","rUXIwGKA","xNJ0Mpbx","umKbm1Rp","Wzzjm5lQ","mhZtY2lR","4GyXKCLd","hLV8Q8uu","IZskON6d"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"mhZtY2lR","project_id":"AANobbMI","author_id":"TEZXhE2U","featured":true,"name":"Sodium 0.5.8","version_number":"mc1.20.1-0.5.8","changelog":"- Fixed compatibility with Fabric API 0.95.3+ when using High Contrast or Programmer Art resource packs.\n- Improved support for keyboard accessibility features in parts of the video settings screen.

Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod for editing configs directly in-game.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Zvh47yt.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:

Read below for setup instructions.\n\nFabric versions depend on [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n\nRequired both on client and server\n\n\nIf you encounter any issues please report them on issue tracker\n\n[Detailed setup guide(Recommended)](https://github.com/CmdrJane/time-and-wind/wiki/Setting-Up)\n\nSetup:\n\nWhile in game use /taw set-cycle-length <dimension> <day length> <night length>\n\nFor example /taw set-cycle-length minecraft:overworld 24000 9000 will set day duration to 24000 ticks and night to 9000 ticks for dimension overworld\n\n20 ticks = 1 second, 1200 ticks = 1 minute, 72 000 ticks = 1 hour\n\nIf you want to remove configuration for world use /taw remove-cycle-entry <dimension>\n\nWorld id can be obtained using /taw get-current-world-id, this command will print id of current world you are in\n\nYou can also navigate to config/time-and-wind/time-data.json and make changes there.\n\nAfter all changes made use /taw reload to apply them\n\n#### Seizure warning: Setting values less than 12000 may cause epilepsy or other unwanted side effects!\n\nNote: Custom configuration for dimensions that have fixed time will obviously not work. In Vanilla you can only configure custom time length for overworld, but if you have modded dimensions without fixed time you will be able to set custom time length for them and it will work.\n\n\nThis mod also patches getSkyAngle method in order to make day and night length even since in vanilla day is a little bit longer than night. This can be disabled in config file.\n\n\nHow does mod works:\n\nUsing mixin mod redirects call to setTime in tickTime method passing control to custom ticker method. That means you don't need to set game rule doDayLightCycle to false for this mod to function.\n\nFor further information you can check [this package on github](https://github.com/CmdrJane/time-and-wind/tree/1.19.4/src/main/java/ru/aiefu/timeandwindct/tickers)\n\n[Video Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZxkBkoJL1o&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Flegacy.curseforge.com%2F&source_ve_path=Mjg2NjY&feature=emb_logo)\n\n \nModpack permission: Very yes","published":"2023-07-02T01:00:10.595421Z","updated":"2023-12-20T02:46:05.817354Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":95612,"followers":57,"categories":["game-mechanics","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["xyGo8Lhp","b89DFps7","m2K6lODF","ekUhgFYi","FaFtc7bt","KFjv7bVx","8vT0D2cU","S5bGqt8i"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/e7pPr7RQ/375d7eb8c324a74fdd318658582f9cfa949035d9.png"},"version":{"id":"FaFtc7bt","project_id":"e7pPr7RQ","author_id":"W0Cc2qRP","featured":false,"name":"Time & Wind 1.4.8+1.20-1.20.1","version_number":"1.4.8+1.20-1.20.1","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-18T12:38:06.241022Z","downloads":78252,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"1022457b115552a2326a86570899e4c3a10ca57b","sha512":"4f39832e1f318a5f47aaeee3c79c5e4e0807830bd1836863d56b216e8bcf597c90d897b7a5c3556eb314a69c6793de45b423d6a11f524523ab5fcea3ddbbb864"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/e7pPr7RQ/versions/FaFtc7bt/time-and-wind-ct-1.4.8%2B1.20-1.20.1.jar","filename":"time-and-wind-ct-1.4.8+1.20-1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":67076,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"eN4lXnj0","user":{"id":"W0Cc2qRP","username":"CmdrJane","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48736985?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T10:43:40.863236Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"time-and-wind-ct-1.4.8+1.20-1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\more-geodes-1.9.jar":{"sha512":"f09a1c2d7927135602a83641e39fb5c3114bfde339cc1246f5addb2fec412ab5713ae9a9f34c7d1f29cdb680ffd5f7a32fa7434411658ba3489adc344489eeee","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"oGmBThKh","slug":"more-geodes","project_type":"mod","team":"MNKLMsZo","title":"More Geodes","description":"Adds Emerald, Quartz, Diamond, and more geodes!","body":"### Join me on Discord! https://discord.gg/aqASuWebRU\n\n## Forge Version: https://modrinth.com/mod/more-geodes-reforged\n\n# More Geodes!\n\nWith the addition of Amethyst Geodes in the Caves and Cliffs Update, I felt that Emerald Geodes would be a neat feature in addition to amethyst geodes. The idea of emerald geodes is to incentivize mining for emeralds, rather than trading for them and also provides less experienced players with a relatively intuitive way of farming emeralds. Since then, this mod has expanded to also include Quartz Geodes, Diamond Geodes, and Echo Geodes! \n\n# Emerald Geodes\n\nEmerald geodes behave very similarly to amethyst geodes; they generate at high elevations throughout the Overworld, though they are most abundant in Mountain-type biomes. They are encased in calcite and smooth basalt casings underground and can grow emerald crystal buds. When these buds are harvested, they of course drop emeralds. This provides an automate-able alternative to emerald farming rather than just trading endlessly.\n\n<center>\n<figure>\n  <img\n  src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheDeathlyCow/more-geodes/main/docs/images/emerald_geode.png\"\n  alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption>Iron Golems jealously guard the Village's Emerald Geode</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</center>\n\n# Quartz Geodes\nQuartz geodes are a little more special. While their growth mechanics are identical to amethyst and emerald geodes, they generate exclusively in The Nether, and with tuff instead of calcite. Their buds also have a special **oscillator** property. When powered with an external redstone signal, they will pulse on and off, emitting a signal like a redstone clock! The frequency of these pulses increases as the crystal grows. \n\n<center>\n<figure>\n  <img\n  src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheDeathlyCow/more-geodes/main/docs/images/quartz_geode.png\"\n  alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption>A Quartz Geode is exposed under an overhang in a Soul Sand Valley</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</center>\n\n# Diamond Geodes\n\nDiamond geodes are best thought of as small goody boxes you will sometimes come across when mining. They have no budding block, so **diamonds cannot be grown like in other geodes**. They also only have one cluster type, which will drop 1 diamond when broken, scaling with fortune. Diamond geodes also generate flooded and with deepslate coal ore in place of calcite, as they are formed from carbon deposits in real life (and not in geodes, but hey its Minecraft). \n\n<center>\n<figure>\n  <img\n  src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheDeathlyCow/more-geodes/main/docs/images/diamond_geode.png\"\n  alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption>A drained Diamond Geode is excavated for its riches</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</center>\n\n# Echo Geodes\n\nEcho Geodes generate in the Deep Dark, and can renewably produce Echo Shards. They generate with an outer layer of blackstone, a middle layer of sculk, and an inner layer of the new Echo Block! Echo blocks, budding echo blocks, and all the echo crystals behave very similarly to their amethyst counter parts - except they echo whenever they make a sound! \n\n<center>\n<figure>\n  <img\n  src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheDeathlyCow/more-geodes/main/docs/images/echo_geode.png\"\n  alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption>The Warden blocks entry into an Echo Geode</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</center>\n\n# Lapis Lazuli Geodes\n\nLapis Lazuli Geodes generate abundantly in deserts, and at shallow depths in the rest of the Overworld. Instead of Calcite, they have a middle layer of **Pyrite** (commonly known as Fool's Gold). Pyrite can be crafted in stairs, slabs, and walls, and even bartered with Piglins! Small Lapis Buds will drop a chunk of Pyrite when mined, so there is a reason to farm them over the clusters.\n\n<center>\n<figure>\n  <img\n  src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheDeathlyCow/more-geodes/main/docs/images/lapis_geode.png\"\n  alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption>A Lapis Lazuli Geode on the side of a cave entrance in a Desert</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</center>\n\n# Gypsum Roses\n\nBased on real-life Desert Roses, Gypsum Roses can be found on the surface of deserts and badlands, and grow to be much larger than other crystals. They can be harvested for their Gypsum Shards, which can be composted and craft sand. They can also be cut into a new decorative block set, or crafted to make the [Crystal Locator](#crystal-and-echo-locator)!\n\n<center>\n<figure>\n  <img\n  src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheDeathlyCow/more-geodes/main/docs/images/gypsum_patch.png\"\n  alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption>A couple patches of Gypsum Roses growing in the desert</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</center>\n\n# Crystal and Echo Locator\n\nThe Crystal Locator is an item that can be used to help find geodes. When tuned to the correct Crystal type, they can be used to make any nearby crystal clusters or buds of the corresponding type glow for about a second and make a dinging sound. They are crafted using 4 Gypsum Shards and 2 sticks. The Crystal locator can be tuned to Amethyst, Emerald, Quartz, Lapis Lazuli, Diamond, and Echo geodes. There is also integration for [Spectrum's](https://modrinth.com/mod/spectrum) geodes.\n\nThe Echo Locator is a more late-game version of the Crystal Locator. It is more tuned to the frequency of ores, and can therefore be used to help locate those pesky ores hidden just inside the wall of a cave or mineshaft.\n\n# Optional Datapack Addons\n\nTwo optional data pack add-ons can be installed with this mod. These add-ons can be downloaded on the Releases tab of this mod's GitHub here: https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/more-geodes/releases/\n\n(Not that these releases are not approved by Modrinth)\n\n## Disable Emerald and Quartz Ore Generation\n\nThis does exactly as it says: it disables the generation of emerald and quartz ore so that geodes are the only way to obtain their respective resources (from mining, anyway).\n\n## Budding Blocks Silktouchable\nThis allows Budding Amethyst, Budding Echo, Budding Emerald, and Budding Quartz blocks to drop themselves when mined with silk touch!\n\n# Configuration and More Detail\n\nYou can find much more detail about configuration and how the mod works in the [read me](https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/more-geodes/blob/main/README.md)!\n\n# Requirements\n\nThis mod requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api). If you are using Quilt, you must use [Quilited Fabric API/Quilt Standard Library](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl) instead.

I will get these onto Forge when I have time, though More Geodes Reforged will likely move exclusively to NeoForge for >1.20.1. \n\n## Geode Placement Overhaul \n\nMany mod packs make use of cave biome mods that dominate the underground and make the appearance of many geodes very rare. Therefore, this update allows emerald and lapis geodes, which previously generated exclusively in a selection of surface biomes, to now generate in any biome. However they generate with a greater frequency in their 'home' biomes. The specific changes are as follows:\n\n* Emerald Geodes now generate at high elevations in all overworld biomes\n* Emerald Geodes now generate much more frequently in Mountains-type biomes \n* Lapis Lazuli Geodes now generate in shallow depths in all overworld biomes\n* Lapis Lazuli Geodes now generate much more frequently in Desert-type biomes\n\n## Crystal Locator and Echo Locator Overhaul\n\nThe Echo Locator was a fairly janky and not particularly helpful block. It has now been reworked into an item that provides a more useful function for its late-game status, and its old geode-locating functionality has been given to a new Crystal Locator. \n\n* Added the Crystal Locator \n  - The Crystal Locator is crafted from Gypsum Shards, and must be tuned to the frequency of a particular Geode. \n  - The Crystal Locator takes damaged when it detects a geode\n  - The tunings for Crystal Locators are data-driven, and can be defined for geodes in other mods.\n  - More Geodes provides tunings for Spectrum out of the box. \n* Reworked the Echo Locator\n  - Removed the Echo Locator 'variants' entirely from the game code \n  - Removed the Echo Locator block and block entity \n  - The Echo Locator is no longer used for finding Geodes. \n  - The Echo Locator now detects all ores, buds, and clusters within a 6-block radius of the player when used, and takes damage for each ore found.\n  - This is to allow you to get those sneaky little ores just hiding behind a couple of blocks of stone.\n* The Echo Display no longer has weird z-fighting with the block it is highlighting \n* Replaced the echo sound with something a little more charming \n* The Echo Display now delays its time to glow based on the distance it was spawned from the player. This has the effect of the glow outlines 'pulsing' out like a radar wave when using the Crystal or Echo Locator.\n\n## Gypsum Block Set\n\nA new desert-themed decorative block set has been added for Gypsum \n\n* Added Polished Gypsum Block, Stairs, Slab, and Wall\n* Added Smooth Gypsum Block, Stairs, Slab, and Wall\n* Added Chiseled Gypsum\n* Added Gypsum Pillar\n\n## Other changes and fixes\n\n* Bismuth Geodes will now generate in the Crystal Gardens if Spectrum is installed.\n* Added the cluster and bud blocks added by More Geodes to the respective Fabric conventional tags\n* Fixed Gypsum Roses and Large Gypsum Buds not dropping Gypsum Shards when mining the top half of the blocks ([#49](https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/more-geodes/issues/49))\n* Fixed Piglins rapidly consuming entire stacks of Pyrite after their first barter ([#52](https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/more-geodes/issues/52)) -- Piglins now ignore Pyrite if they have seen it before.\n* Fixed the 'Is there an Echo in here?' advancement not working due to a broken tag ([by kingkuys2123 #39](https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/more-geodes/pull/39))\n* Added Ukrainian translations ([by unroman #36](https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/more-geodes/pull/36))\n* Added Russian translations ([by Tefnya #42](https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/more-geodes/pull/42))\n* Added Norwegian translations ([by Bloodaxe95 #41](https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/more-geodes/pull/41))\n* Note that while these translations are just being released in this update, they were all made before the implementation of the above features and as such are already a bit out of date!

All other websites distributing the mod are not owned/affiliated with me and might publish incorrect or outdated mod files or even worse malware.**\n\n## Current features\n\n* When hovering over items you can scroll up and down to send single items up and down.\n  * When holding _shift_ alongside you may send whole stacks of items.\n  * When holding _control_ alongside you can move all stacks of the same type of item.\n  * When you're in scrollable inventories you might want to press _alt_ to prevent scrolling items.\n* When you're sending items via shift-leftclick you can now hold both buttons to send all stacks you're hovering over\n* Hold alt-leftclick to drop items quickly.\n* When you're in the creative inventory and hover over the tab icons you can scroll through all the creative tabs and pages.\n* In your facourite recipe books you can:\n  * hover over the recipe grid to scroll through the pages.\n  * hover over the recipe group tabs to scroll through them.\n* Sort inventories by clicking with your mouse wheel (you can also define an own keybinding)\n  * sorts by raw id (will most likely group by mods and similar items)\n  * hold _shift_ while clicking to sort by quantity\n  * hold _control_ while clicking to sort by alphabet\n  * You can customize which sort modes you prefer\n* Press the swap key in any inventory to swap with the offhand\n* Let your slots be automagically refilled from your inventory!\n* Pick the matching tools for blocks by either sneaking while picking the block or by holding a tool. (this is configurable)\n* Right-click trades or recipes to directly apply the crafting. When holding shift it will craft/trade a full stack\n* Also: Armor switch if MW is installed on the server-side 🙂\n\n## Configuration\nLots of stuff is configurable. To open the config screen you'll need to install [Mod Menu](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/modmenu).\n\n## Limitations\nSince this mod is completely clientside item scrolling might be a bit laggy on hard-working servers.\n\n\nThis mod will not work in *Applied Energistics 2* screens and inventories. AE2 handles inventory screens even more strangely than Mojang handles creative inventories, so don't expect any fixes from my side!\n\nTo make you aware of this MW declares a conflict with AE2 which will show up in the log. This incompatibility only applies to certain mods and all other inventories will work fine.\n\n## Before Version 1.3.4\nThere are bugs in Tweed (library used by Mouse Wheelie) and Artifice (library of Extra Pieces) which make these mods incompatible when bundled within other mods.\n\nTo make Mouse Wheelie work with Extra Pieces please install the latest version of Tweed alongside!\n\nWith version 1.3.4 this bug has been fixed in Tweed and my other library mods - so no more incompatibilities from my side. Currently this bug still persists in Artifice so other mods might still be incompatible with Extra Pieces and all derivatives of Artifice.\n","published":"2020-12-22T00:25:18.334979Z","updated":"2023-12-15T14:45:32.209212Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":477064,"followers":1195,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","20w46a","20w48a","20w49a","20w51a","1.16.5-rc1","1.16.5","21w13a","21w14a","21w15a","21w16a","21w17a","21w18a","21w19a","1.17-pre1","1.17-pre2","1.17-pre3","1.17-pre4","1.17-pre5","1.17-rc1","1.17.1-pre1","1.17.1-pre2","1.17.1-pre3","1.17.1-rc1","1.17.1-rc2","1.17.1","1.18-pre1","1.18-pre2","1.18-pre3","1.18-pre4","1.18-pre5","1.18-rc1","1.18-rc2","1.18-rc3","1.18","1.18.1","22w06a","1.18.2","22w16a","22w17a","1.19-pre1","1.19-pre2","1.19-pre3","1.19-pre4","1.19-pre5","1.19-rc1","1.19-rc2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20-pre3","1.20-pre4","1.20-pre5","1.20-pre6","1.20-pre7","1.20-rc1","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["h719hnXo","24XWVv4H","mJVsiau8","yDQNiG1v","8sEmZ1nD","rnZXbVTB","ByYgvJhU","TZ0z6i7D","Ag98NrKK","PggOD3er","Rd0u7syf","6wJJQ33X","Amzyl6VC","HLoh2XXB","E8qJEpfg","7ddYbYW3","iQxwgiAF","TDmKKgak","fzNZlwOq","qcqrslIb","lKmF2uif","cee0obg3","4wlSrHMh","XIM4RiiZ","SycN5fV0","bjmjyen4","2u7IS1Lw","7FltZwOv","8xFCTh5W","zftsBLjV","hQm4udmf","CoYvVu0u","gL7KvZHU","mlAMqe16","RlzDkw4F","DoQwGDO3","rpbGK5iK","iTzFhLN4","pQNfi4Bx","ZQug1Aeg","itUXGzbC","Lf04bCin","SixCZfVc","cCV9Xcrd","IzMqpyhD","WMg1QsIk","FzmzRaLi","fzZPBH5c","5CUmFU4E","3ngJL09J","b9WaTx7Z","Huy754AQ","FktpYSQi","3ytj4zL0","lwpAqVaH","yvwXSQdv","Rr1DcHMq","3J1aNVLJ","23Nw5zzU","iiu83Y3c","UeiAKbpX","gFA95EIa","zY7Cf3LW","cM3ObaFu","fHlm0rzK","agVRPZ4D","MPCf9ut6","PEKBd3El","PkISnwUh","GfgvMtyQ","xwp8g9CO","FOq96T8x","xTx0O62x","lXkJSYAH","yQusLI7s","fNtdHcP5","6Y1z49b4","khSmZgLT","TEtrxmrp","wUp62kni","wBqPB5xY","tXfvYvI1","2ebv7N77","VinQJO3v","ymIYCJPX","b1B6X2Ts","NTpvjLr2","a4SvIbAl","Soe84zhH","dryZj18F","DQZQWgOz","nJNMgakE","nmB6cDYk","7hY6TItH","KY8qViXG","P6lILGgm","chRnLbfn","GdHlLNRp","va0UPMPO","jHVCUNXq","J0haBi6t","Zl5ysFVm","mnbVSXOO","5HmD82tm","idJfKEnz","bCGRhsZx","KMjUmnju","Ja2BYc1Y","o6RxDq9H","oaIp47rP","OhnrKojw","fLRP12Mt","iIdZaHt3","ZvHQfeTB","xQflaC4T","gjck3ULm","SqayzTTv","HO17Gk1z","rIYypwDC","lcCY0KZL","rvkjp7nF","93JSZCN4","dgBoPrse","4iex10ex","5aMlBb4H","e0rd3G30","3K7SCKOR","Mm0H8wn7","BEsP37OJ","8n4MvQ1n","CkjvPWpv","sgkCkgSO","Gud3HLU2","VoRXECAU","lgzMuZBH","FbQkpg7G","EPlvximc","6uHsa6Rn","f24IuTiJ","q2BSIY4P","8oect3E2","HDUIbH1G","ayAWRAes","JGZJ4UqD","tBQLIhI1","PQGEoKza","1xCyaLWg","MC48NEHw","5mYFyLcg","2VMUOKtw","vv9WzK01","ugx6shZH","R0tsn51l","uaxAu6IZ","4hjGaj6D","c6Ht2mCa","yb0UJjSM","MpGOHks3","Y0sGEyyU","fWlmQNBf","3ni9nRcB","WzN3aIKG","vpoRSwN4","GlENOQej","5q5ojaBJ","WOL5XBup","bTHE5J3n","o7VxXDbj","UygfI1MO","HPzsUVnT","faPpjxKD","uQqxNGqs","hUZXtd1H","pgVpuqvW","C3dGBp1r","vymcxgLT","T7Ogh3Ft","Nbpfn58U","EJvmB978","jyqMTpO1","jNgyObL0","wZQXaled","iTSdJaug","371iEBPS","tTMaU713","r1RocWRi","8RLuRzch","QmT8RpnQ","eN3F8JKA","Xyl3zo4h","ZipUueYk","QXkLg21K","cu12faXh","m0dAzH9I","LeOE3qju","I5ILhd6J","auT5QGkW","f0VEYjAS","KdK5dXWp","Ow7EojXn","ZfHqIlXv","e8Y4GnH0","SSkZxx08","H7OsQ8Jt","iF7T9odz","5TxOjQHP","uMGgnGSW","4aQoMc29","tcruvzMQ","XvWmUhot","Vd71xYQG","aRVszPQB","aONy2c3p","TCt49JkS","BUydj5yt","KNLEqpmH","yTSkWqiJ","QNBiceN7","1uDKNRQF","ZDH1ONdq","IjbA4WTe","kgCmdbQm","xWpY6VCr","eGC7FVo7","5R7l84zv","kvQiy5Oa","W6lK0S30","wPtDzPBH","jE5B3lub","Hg3JOa79","EzeYeJRf","73ivfwq5"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/u5Ic2U1u/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"wPtDzPBH","project_id":"u5Ic2U1u","author_id":"JJJqUOvE","featured":false,"name":"[1.20.1]

If you like Legacies and Legends, I highly recommend you [check it out!](https://modrinth.com/modpack/legacies)_\n\nMy design process, as an example, wasn't to show you what's on the other side of the Ancient City portal, or what else is out there in the End, or even to explain the past - it's to make you *wonder* what could be, such as vanilla's open-ended lore, only expanded.\n\nLegacies and Legends is, finally, a soundtrack expansion, the first of its kind in this sense. It also adds new items, structures and lore - and ultimately will enrich your playthroughs or even modpacks without changing the core experience.\n\nThe full description continues below the mod showcase.\n\n### Mod Showcase thanks to [Sigma_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5jcpS2Pm-s)\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/k5jcpS2Pm-s\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n### Atmospheric Soundtrack Overhaul\n\nLegacies and Legends introduces several new tracks to the game, all thematic to their locations and carefully selected to ensure they blend perfectly with vanilla. \n\nFor a standalone, vanilla-friendly resource pack, check out [Legacies Music](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/legacies-music)\n\nSeveral new songs (including some left-out ones from the official soundtracks) are added to the game's base soundtrack for various biomes, as well as a bonus track for when you light the end portal. These tracks are considerately weighted to ensure vanilla and C418 music still get their chances to shine. Special thanks to [Firel](https://www.youtube.com/@FirelMusic/videos) for composing [Only the Beginning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a6cEXmaEoM) as a new end track for this mod!\n\nThe soundtrack expansion additionally includes 5 new music discs - Svall (Mineshafts), Taswell (Deep Ruins), Shulker (End Cities) Tundra (Igloo Basements) and Far Lands (crafted from disc fragments scattered across select structures of the overworld).\n\n[Click here to view the complete soundtrack as a youtube playlist!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEvR1_oznfRTQhU5kal0oYrIuSmiEb_ay)\n\n**Bonus: [Nature's Melody](https://modrinth.com/mod/natures-melody) - adds extra music for [Nature's Spirit](https://modrinth.com/mod/natures-spirit)'s biomes, much like Legacies and Legends does for vanilla**\n\n###  Loot Table Reworks\n\nMost structures have seen their loot tables reworked or rebalanced in a vanilla-like fashion - for example, End Cities are mostly untouched, but a Jungle Temple has a few additional items in addition to the chests containing more overall items on average than vanilla. In other cases, you may find entirely new items to the loot tables, such as the enchanted stone tools that can be found rarely in underwater ruins. Regardless the structure, there's a good chance it's seen some changes, anywhere from a slight tweak to a complete overhaul.\n\nIn addition to this, a few new, rare items are added to further expand on the atmospheric and lore side of structure loot. 3 new, extremely (trust me, super hard to find) rare armor sets (don't worry, they're perfectly balanced against vanilla and won't stuff with balance or progression) provide additional worldbuilding - namely the Ward (Deep Ruins, Sculk Ruins, Ancient Cities), Fortress (Nether Fortress) and Dungeon (Dungeons) armor sets. Again, while they can spawn in these structures, they are very rare and make great bonus loot without messing up the core game's functions, thanks to their careful balancing and inherent rarity. They can be repaired using echo shards, blaze rods and iron ingots respectively.\n\nI haven't just added armor sets to the game, however. I've taken some inspiration from Minecraft's early days - filled with random new features and items that often had no reason to exist, but did anyway. There are a few other small items that provide an enriched loot experience. Firstly is Bottomless Beetroot - as the name suggests, it's beetroot that doesn't go away when eaten! It's quite rare, and generally found in places where golden apples are found - including Mineshafts and Jungle Temples, and can even be crafted into Bottomless Beetroot Soup, a powerful food source, albeit extremely difficult to acquire, as you need 6 to craft it.\n\nSecondly, we've got some new ocean-themed loot... because fishing is boring, and, after all this new content, I thought the ocean needed some love - I want to ensure everything is treated equally. We've got useless Wooden Buckets, because why not? At least they can be furnace fuel (and, if you surround them with coal in the crafting table, are really great at being fuel too)... but don't worry, fishing can now provide Metal Chunks, hard metal scrap that can be smelted into iron nuggets, as an insignificant bonus source of materials while fishing. Most importantly, however, is the new Hook item (repaired with the aforementioned Metal Chunks), a fishing-inspired weapon, that while not able to compete with lategame weapons, makes for a fun and fast-hitting midgame slasher.\n\nThirdly, we've got the Ancient Knife (repaired using copper ingots). Complete with Farmer's Delight compatibility, this new weapon, much like the Hook, can't quite compete with a netherite sword - but is fun and effective nonetheless. It can be found rarely in suspicious gravel at the Trail Ruins or new Ruin structure.\n\nFinally, we've got Super Suspicious Sand. It's super suspiciously normal-looking. And floats. It can also be smelted into the most pointless glass you've ever seen... refuse to float. You can find it as a rare drop from Husks.\n\n### New Structures\n\nLegacies and Legends includes quite a few new structures, all small and carefully balanced to keep them nice, rare and unobtrusive - perfect for vanilla integration... and expanding on the lore.\n\nThese include Ruins (anywhere Trail Ruins are found), Deep Ruins (found underground at y-52, once outposts of the Ancient Cities), Sculk Ruins (y-52 deep dark), Underground Remnants (y5 to y55 underground), Ruined Libraries (overground in plains and forests), Cherry Ruins (it's 1.20, so I added a nice, rare structure to the Cherry Grove), a new ruined nether structure (super rare, I'll let you see them for yourself), and 2 new ruined structures for the End dimension.\n\nAs you can probably tell, these structures, while seemingly plentiful, are all quite rare, vanilla-style and closely linked to the lore, and, trust me, will feel like only a couple new structures in your world - I do not believe in structure clutter unlike many other structure mods. \n\n### Lore Expansion\n\nFinally, the piece that brings it all together. Lore. The lore expansion is closely linked with many new structures, items and even music, but there's an added component - many structures now have a very low chance to contain a lore book, a written book with a short excerpt of lore embedded. There are quite a few, and are designed to complement the very minimalistic and open-ended lore and story of the base game in similar ways.\n\nThey've all been carefully written, and are fully vanilla-compliant and not immersion breaking (they are quite open-ended and aren't throwing made-up lore at you) whatsoever, even if you dislike the idea of them. Trust me, find one and you'll get what I mean. \n\nFor obvious reasons, I can't say more about this, but I hope you have a blast uncovering all the new lore over your playthroughs.\n\n### Credits\n\nCredit to Blockus for the cracked end stone bricks texture, which was used instead of making my own for consistency in modpack projects.

For 5GB ram, they charge under $13USD a month for Performance, and under $6 for Budget, not including my discount code! I personally use their performance servers, and their specs, price, support and easy-to-use panel are the best of all the hosts I've been with. In addition, you can **[use code LEGACY for 15% off](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=55)** your first month!\n\n<details>\n<summary>More Info</summary>\n\nYes, I am partnered with them (and a member of their feedback team), but as an already-existing customer of them (and have paid and still pay for their servers myself), I can legitimately say they're great, regardless of whether I'm partnered with them. They're just genuinely good, I know the support team, they're super friendly and quick. The server specs are as good as you can get, and importantly, they aren't overpriced, unlike other hosts - in fact, they're less than half the price of quite a few big competitors I've seen around here, with no downside! If you need a server, these guys truly know what you're doing, and will respect your wallet when they do it. If you buy a server through my link, you even help support my work!\n\n</details>\n\n[![Kinetic Hosting - code LEGACY for 15% off!](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/nWCaRO9f/images/f02dc42b387e658c878b1df92499fd6d071dcbb2.png)](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=55)\n\nWant to see me work on my projects and stream Minecraft gameplay live?

This allows you to have Minecraft open on one monitor, while using other programs on another monitor - as normally Minecraft minimises when you unfocus it. This mod also adds the Borderless Windowed option to the Video Settings screen, so you can easily disable the mod ingame, and has a configuration menu accessible through Mod Menu.\n\n\nWorks on vanilla servers, and modded servers without the mod installed!\n\n\nThis mod is a rewrite of a Forge 1.12 mod, [Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-windowed-borderless-for-minecraft), however it used to be a fork of that mod (which the 1.12 version of this mod is) - see the bottom of this page for the original description.\n\n\nSee [Borderless Window](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/borderless) by nekeras if you're looking for a similar mod for Forge 1.14+.\n\n\nOn macOS this mod is disabled by default, as it is impossible to position the window above the menu bar, and macOS has better fullscreen support anyway.\n\n\n<details><summary>Old 1.12.2 mod description</summary>\n\nThis is the latest released version (1.6.0) of the mod [Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-windowed-borderless-for-minecraft) by hancin for MC 1.12-1.12.2, plus a fix for window resizing by me, compiled by Brycey92. This fork will be obsolete if [this PR](https://github.com/hancin/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/pull/27) is merged.\n\nThis fixes the bug where the window is not resizable after exiting fullscreen. This is a bug in LWJGL, and is fixed by [Fullscreen Fix](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-fix) and in current versions of Forge. However, the existing fixes are not applied to Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless), so this fork fixes it in that mod.\n\nSee the original Github post by Brycey92 [here](https://github.com/Brycey92/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/releases/tag/1.6.0-1).\n\nThe 1.12.2 build had the following links: [Source](https://github.com/comp500/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft), [Issues](https://github.com/comp500/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/issues)\n\n**The 1.12.2 build is licensed under the following license:**\n\nCopyright (c) 2015-2017, David Larochelle-Pratte\\\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\\\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1\\.

and mobs.\n\n \n*EMI Loot is in beta! Please expect features to change and be added as development continues.*\n\n*This mod is for Fabric and Quilt. A Forge port is not planned at this time.*\n\n*All credit goes to EmilyPloszaj for the creation of EMI itself. This is just a plugin.*\n\n[![Join the Discord](https://i.imgur.com/iXATO6K.png)](https://discord.gg/zDbaYmUba2)\n\n#### Wiki\n\nFor guides on how to use the data-driven systems in EMI Loot, please see [the wiki](https://github.com/fzzyhmstrs/EMI_loot/wiki)\n\n#### Notable Features\n\n- Chest loot is sorted by percentage and includes drops added to the loot tables by mods.\n- If a chest has too many loot options to fit onto the screen, EMI Loot will condense the output into lists of items stacked by same-percentage. Hovering over a certain percentage list will show the possible stacks you can expect to get at that probability.\n- Stack sizes shown represent the average item count you can expect to pull at a time (before factoring in the probability).\n- Block drops have been added. These views show the various drops available, split into different categories based on any particular circumstances needed to get that drop (Silk Touch, Shears, etc).\n- Mob drops have been added. Shows drops available split into categories based on circumstances needed to acquire them (only when a mob is on fire, extra with looting, etc)\n\n\n#### Features to come\n- Implement resource-pack driven system for defining custom conditions and how to parse them.\n- Add in fishing and other gameplay loot\n\n\n","published":"2022-09-25T22:13:18.112945Z","updated":"2024-04-14T19:44:37.194905Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":577175,"followers":227,"categories":["library","management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["g010jnKd","YvsiPoNW","sMYv0WU4","rEZyE6x3","hME9LTtZ","iiGhUAPe","UoqcWBE6","dsAxQzyr","R27L5Wrs","dDsA0q1m","AnKDZCEA","nkW4UzlO","OeVpkByV","byhOHBwi","pFHgMv8g","FzY7HsGk","WLrmskq7","TM0YFork","h5EhjjmQ","nH2jMxUZ","finLaORs","8VxvWtcW","b7JoJE05","p0Ugm9eu","odt1Mqrz","YZu0lWye","48q801AN","vWadFDyM","ge7Vbplt","9rpAPYB9","Xn48U1HI","Rp2bjZ9t","mPCfosCw","x6vIf3HD","tR4xqoxp","7rjmttb6","7fjkgVEh","GUbMMJRo","91c49w5V","95aOKine","O3uMSDN0","6rFgo1Px","lwhMjJHL"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qbbO7Jns/dec44ad1547e774b6fce97a5268f6ff6309ec40a.png"},"version":{"id":"lwhMjJHL","project_id":"qbbO7Jns","author_id":"ANKRvkxl","featured":false,"name":"EMI Loot 0.6.6+1.20.1","version_number":"0.6.6+1.20.1","changelog":"* Update of condition icons, thanks to [gayasslily](https://modrinth.com/user/gayasslily)!\n* Fix thundering/not-thundering condition icons being missing\n* Added `canSend` check to packets\n* Fixed chest loot parsing not reading in chances added via `RandomChanceLootCondition`\n* Added ru_ru lang, thanks to [mpustovoi]https://github.com/mpustovoi)!\n* Fixed loot recipes not updating on datapack reload, thanks to [Abbie5](https://modrinth.com/user/Abbie)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-14T19:44:38.123888Z","downloads":52466,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"ee215cef8c3a916d1ee084de1804c343c0167ae20123a03f60185c79fb6480db6c7a949769637eef834c31a0497afe8cffb002ddb739db9bec42bdc7be6ca417","sha1":"1ecb08d3a45f000e835e9214eb6bae282bd8fdb0"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qbbO7Jns/versions/lwhMjJHL/emi_loot-0.6.6%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"emi_loot-0.6.6+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":363534,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"fRiHVvU7","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"A6CuhMKl","user":{"id":"fjpxz8db","username":"gayasslily","name":"Lily","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/fjpxz8db/8008d5d853889ec78ed06111577a56de684d0044.png","bio":"Creator of the modpack 'Lily's Vanilla OverQuilted'.\n\nI also make textures for stuff.","created":"2022-06-10T14:24:39.516887Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist","ordering":0},{"team_id":"A6CuhMKl","user":{"id":"ANKRvkxl","username":"fzzyhmstrs","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72876796?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-04-13T21:42:13.876320Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"emi_loot-0.6.6+1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\explosive-enhancement-1.2.2-1.20.x.jar":{"sha512":"f946a5ba189a5d0fdeb64a1d3f9b7cbc8daeaa4ab94fc4b07d0904e3c9883233a1fae9e3e7040cf2e9d9262be06241614e3933b9ca720619164b95f6af15ae22","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"OSQ8mw2r","slug":"explosive-enhancement","project_type":"mod","team":"RCkqJVDY","title":"Explosive Enhancement","description":"Makes the explosion animation look cooler.","body":"# Explosive Enhancement\n\n### Enhancing explosions since 2023.\n\nExplosive Enhancement is a simple mod that makes explosions look better.

height=\"59\" /><br />\n<b>An overhaul of the main End Island where the dragon fight takes place!</b>\n<p>Obsidian pillars, End gateways, the spawn platform, and the portal itself in the middle of the island have all been redesigned. Additionally, the dragon no longer spawns from the start - instead, it will be summoned once a player gets close to the bell tower in the center.</p>\n<p>To resummon the dragon, the 4 crystals no longer go right next to the portal. Instead, you'll see 4 bedrock blocks on the floor inside the tower, one in each directional wing of the building. The crystals can be placed on these 4 blocks to start summoning the dragon again. That being said, we do actually still support vanilla crystal summoning positions, to avoid confusing players who aren't familiar with the mod.</p>\n<p>The dragon's AI itself is unchanged.</p>\n<p><b>To use BEI on an existing world,</b> we've provided the <i>/end_island reset</i> command. Using this command while in the End will attempt to reset the dragon fight back to its initial state and replace any previous portal/pillars with our redesigned versions. But this command attempts some major things behind the scenes, so <b>please back up your world before trying!</b> Also note that <b>simply deleting your End dimension files is not suffificient, and you will still need to run the command.</b></p>\n<p>If you're having issues with the portal/tower spawning after using the command, such as the portal spawning under the island, you can use the full command `/end_island reset true` to attempt to place the portal on the surface again. But once again, back up your world before trying it!

This mod is designed primarily for low-end devices.\nThere's [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXWdDoVU1C4) through.\n\n**Q**: Which mod loaders are supported?  \n**A**: Forge, Fabric, Quilt, NeoForge, Legacy Fabric, Ornithe (for both Fabric and Quilt).\n\n**Q**: Which versions are supported?  \n**A**: Minecraft 1.8 or newer. There may be a backport to older versions in the future.\n\n**Q**: Where are the Forge, Fabric, Quilt, NeoForge, etc. versions?  \n**A**: All in the same file.\n\n**Q**: Do I need Fabric API or Quilt Standard Libraries?  \n**A**: Nope, but you can have it installed for other mods.\n\n**Q**: Is it open source?  \n**A**: [Yes.](https://github.com/VidTu/Ksyxis) (Licensed\nunder [MIT License](https://github.com/VidTu/Ksyxis/blob/main/LICENSE))\n\n**Q**: Is it stable for use?  \n**A**: It should be. No guarantee though. At least it should not break your worlds, you just won't be able to load them\nwith this mod and can uninstall it to load otherwise.\n\n**Q**: How to force-load chunks for ticking if spawn chunks have been removed?  \n**A**: If you really need ticking chunks, load individual chunks with the `/forceload` vanilla command in 1.13 or newer.\nFor older versions, you can search for some mod that force-loads chunks.\n\n**Q**: I found a bug.  \n**A**: Report it [here](https://github.com/VidTu/Ksyxis/issues).

These are crafted with four ender pearls, four eyes of ender, and any dye, like so:</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/DIW7Dn6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"509\" height=\"290\" /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;\">Once you have your portal catalysts, you'll want to build frames for your portals out of the block of your choice. The frames can be any size and shape (for versions before 3.2.0, they must be rectangular).<br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;\">When you're done, right click on the inside of the frame with your portal catalyst, and the portal will activate. Do the same where you want the other portal to be. If both of your portals are made out of the same materials and are within range, they will automatically link to each other and you will be able to travel between them. Portals that are linked will have an animated, lit-up texture and emit particles. By default, you will spawn in the center of your portal. You can change your portal's spawn position by shift-right-clicking the portal block you want to set it to with an empty hand.<br /></span></p>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;\">Applying a redstone signal to a portal now turns it off!</span></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;\">Want to make portals that are only one way?

If you have both <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu\">Mod Menu</a> and <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config\">Cloth Config</a> installed, you can navigate to Custom Portals in the mod menu in-game, click the settings icon in the corner, and set \"Portals Always Have Unlimited Range\" to \"yes\". Otherwise, you can navigate to the customportals.conf file in the config directory of your .minecraft folder and change \"portals_always_unlimited\" to \"true\".

By \"purely technical\" I mean that it won't add any content to your game.\n\n### The Problem\n\nMod creators are encouraged to use tags where possible, e.g. when creating a recipe. If mods are supposed to work together though, they should all share a same base of common \"conventional\" tags, which group certain items together. Not all developers add their items to common tags though, which means that a person playing with many mods or a mod pack creator might need to create long lists of all items which fulfill certain criteria to add them to specific tags.\n\n### The Solution\n\nUpon loading a world, this mod will automatically populate some tags based on code conditions, covering all modded content as well.\n\nIt's mostly relevant for mod pack creators who need / want to configure mods by adding to specific tags - this allows them to e.g. easily add all armor items to a tag, because they'll all be bundled in `c:armor`.\n\nAs another example, all items which are equippable in the head slot will land in a tag called `c:head_equippables`:\n\n![Screenshot of the `c:head_equippables` tag](https://i.imgur.com/2E36FZS.png)\n \n\n### Additional Information\n\nFor an overview of the tags the mod currently adds, as well as the blacklist option via datapacks, [view the README on GitHub](https://github.com/apace100/autotag/blob/1.18/README.md).\n\nIf you have any suggestions for new tags, feel free to post them in the comments or [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/apace100/autotag/issues)!\n\n\n\nI hope this mod helps someone and makes their life a bit easier. :)\n\n----\n\nThe mod icon is a composition of modified icons created by Lorc and Delapouite, found on game-icons.net.","published":"2022-04-27T08:43:12.453767Z","updated":"2023-07-07T18:57:46.548975Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":344924,"followers":70,"categories":["library","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["zTLVD3Ir","iLNm8Z6p","50kM3UvN","VoyNngbb","sXJE2Hnq","cC57ynct","ocD9XA8D"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8FdYDHF5/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"ocD9XA8D","project_id":"8FdYDHF5","author_id":"g6LkRuia","featured":true,"name":"1.20: AutoTag 2.0.2","version_number":"2.0.2+1.20","changelog":"Updated to 1.20 and 1.20.1","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-07T18:57:47.526842Z","downloads":248114,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"78183b1e5513c6b6d8bf5477b0cda9d8f86268c4","sha512":"86b27da622ca4d5003e2c78c9da91468fde31e6d57af92e3f346403935818b6b1f02f16114ff11fc635a2f6b7511003c37141fb947d9d8537805b7deff2bbd5d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8FdYDHF5/versions/ocD9XA8D/autotag-2.0.2%2B1.20.jar","filename":"autotag-2.0.2+1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":52660,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"88834ff7cf41166dd8525f16351056d78e5f78f6a2dbd9fdaa35ed8e7a31a7c4126ae734a3a6c5e79e8fec02e55f04b5b3a01364681acf276edcd1ce6612b52f","sha1":"3bce310bba19e53e5958d1b6449115742af0c329"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8FdYDHF5/versions/ocD9XA8D/autotag-2.0.2%2B1.20-sources.jar","filename":"autotag-2.0.2+1.20-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":22444,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"CuOWTsQ5","user":{"id":"G41cEWi2","username":"will_bl","name":"Will BL","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5115825?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-31T22:16:53.367206Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"CuOWTsQ5","user":{"id":"g6LkRuia","username":"Apace","name":"Apace","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/49096778?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-12-08T00:10:08.362286Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"autotag-2.0.2+1.20.jar"},"mods\\postmortalparticles-1.0.0-1.20.x.jar":{"sha512":"30e07aa2c658d52cff2ff70418cd251584f074946c57e3a3f8a98169071b255938afdf0974cd93e92ed93efb6169cac639e38b71e3e8a95644cc4d43010b1bc2","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"5km6gS6P","slug":"postmortal-particles","project_type":"mod","team":"sDKmsgoW","title":"Postmortal Particles","description":"Overhauls the totem of undying particle effect.","body":"# Postmortal Particles\n\n### Overhauls the totem of undying particle effect.\n\nPostmortal Particles adds many new particle effects whenever a totem of undying is activated.

This datapack holds its charm by adding no new biomes, items, mobs, structures, etc... a simple datapack to just make the vanilla Nether better.\n\nAdditionally, Amplified Nether brings back the Nether mountains from the original official Minecraft Nether Update trailer. Many players saw these beautiful mountains, and were upset that they weren't in the game. 3D biomes are used extensively, with much more biome variation. Biome borders that were previously impossible are now commonplace, as any biome can border any other biome!\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ","published":"2022-11-23T00:46:33.906695Z","updated":"2024-05-17T19:52:25.438831Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":115729,"followers":357,"categories":["worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["FBqJR2QM","sB14azEN","70trp5am","DwobyjUi","QXFvBT1u","LGRU0B5J","txd1dBMw","qO36KEYQ"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/wXiGiyGX/1e2c39947ef738f67d7987921dee474c307707e0.png"},"version":{"id":"qO36KEYQ","project_id":"wXiGiyGX","author_id":"oRXQvVNJ","featured":true,"name":"v1.2.5 ~ 1.20.x","version_number":"1.2.5","changelog":"# Amplified Nether 1.2.5\n- Updated to 1.20.5 (supports 1.20-1.20.6)\n- Now supports Neoforge","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-17T19:52:26.527476Z","downloads":8790,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"fdbaa791f7fdc089e558979f9f68a4811584d5f7","sha512":"53f12d659d3e5fb1e03aab50a0a647b5093c633c5baf639d0773de1425526a2049b28bcef1097978bbd91f06f179a3fe8a81817b7ca48ce0f5325bf251d4fd1c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/wXiGiyGX/versions/qO36KEYQ/Amplified_Nether_1.20.x_v1.2.5.jar","filename":"Amplified_Nether_1.20.x_v1.2.5.jar","primary":true,"size":97150,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"ZVzW5oNS","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"incompatible"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"]},"members":[],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Amplified_Nether_1.20.x_v1.2.5.jar"},"mods\\ctov-fabric-3.4.3.jar":{"sha512":"8b6823ac84235268626e8b1c137a20f4f32cfc3956e9c890aea1e3e6aea3f2006fc4bef67c5fed200dedb2e3fd40676714644e2fed08f9f271d9e8d72016d92c","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"fgmhI8kH","slug":"ct-overhaul-village","project_type":"mod","team":"Zs08w8wX","title":"ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Village","description":"Enhances and creates new villages and pillager outposts, that perfectly fit into your Minecraft world.","body":"**![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_HEADER.webp)**\n**![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_BANNER1.webp)**\n\n**ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Village (CTOV) is a mod that adds new and improved villages and pillager outposts to Minecraft.** It is available for both Forge and Fabric, and it works with most world-generation and structure mods. CTOV adds 23 village variants and 14 pillager outpost variants, each of which is tailored to the terrain, theme, and biome of your Minecraft world.\n\nCTOV will not be backported beyond 1.18.2 for the mod version and 1.17 for the datapack version. This means that if you are playing an older version of Minecraft, you will not be able to use CTOV.\n\n<details><summary>FAQs</summary>\n\n1.  **Is it safe to update CTOV to a newer version?**\nYes, it is safe to update CTOV to a newer version. However, if you do experience any problems, please let the mod author know so that they can fix them.\n\n2.  **Is it safe to add CTOV to an already existing world?**\nYes, it is safe to add CTOV to an already existing world. However, the new structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.\n\n3.  **Is this mod for Forge or Fabric/Quilt?**\nCTOV is available for all three mod loaders: Forge, Fabric, and Quilt.\n\n4.  **How can I locate the new structures?**\nTo locate the new structures, you can use the `/locate` command.\n    For 1.18.2, you would use the following command:\n    >  /locate ctov:\\[structure\\_from\\_list\\] <br>\n\n    For 1.19+, you would use the following command:\n    >  /locate structure ctov:[structure_from_list] <br>\n\n    The `[structure_from_list]` part of the command is the name of the structure that you want to locate. You can find a list of all the available structures in the CTOV documentation.\n\n5.  **Does CTOV modify existing vanilla structures?**\nThe only structures that are modified by CTOV are vanilla villages in older versions. In newer versions, CTOV creates its own structures that are separate from vanilla villages.\n\n6.  **What about the loot of these structures?**\nThe vast majority of structures use vanilla loot tables for better mod compatibility. However, they also use some custom loot tables to integrate said structures into the world better. You will still find pillager outpost loot in pillager outposts, profession chests in villages, as well as bells, workstations, etc., but you may also find new stuff like food, armour, and other goodies.\n\n7.  **How can I report bugs/issues/suggestions?**\nTo report bugs, issues, or suggestions, please go to the CTOV GitHub repo and create an issue. You can also message the mod author on Discord.\n\n8.  **Can I include CTOV in my modpack?**\nYes, you can include CTOV in your modpack. However, please be sure to give credit to the mod author and provide a link to their page.\n\n9.  **Can I have CTOV for 1.x.x, please?**\nIf it's lower than 1.18.2, no. Please don't ask this question. The technical limit is too high here.\n\n10.  **Can I give Choicetheorem any commission or support?**\nThe mod author does not accept commissions or monetary support. They are doing this as a hobby and do not want to be paid for their work.\n\nI hope this answers all of your questions.\n</details>\n\n**![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_BANNER4.webp)**\n\n\nChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Village (CTOV) is compatible with most world-generation and structure mods. Full documentation is [here](https://github.com/ChoiceTheorem/ChoiceTheorem-s-overhauled-village/wiki/Compatibility)\n\nIt also works with Guard Villager and other structure packs by ChoiceTheorem.\nMods that add new villagers will need compatibility packs.\n\nHere are some more details about the compatibility of CTOV with other mods:\n\n- **World-generation mods:** CTOV relies on vanilla biome Tags, so almost all world-generation mods like Terralith, Oh Biome You'll Go, and Biomes O'plenty will have appropriate CTOV villages in their biomes.\n- **Structure mods:** Various structure mods like Town&Tower and Repurposed structures also work well with CTOV. However, it is important to exercise caution when using too many mods, as this can cause instability. The same applies to Better Village.\n- **Other mods:** Any other mod that doesn't affect villages and villagers will be compatible by default.\n- Mods that add new villagers will need compatibility packs, which can be found on the CurseForge website.\n\nMod integration\n\nAs a rule of thumb, it's compatible. If it isn't yet, It will be.

Whether it is a visual or functional tweak, feel free to make an issue as well.\n\n\n## Features\n\n- Screen filling UI (instead of the tiny one used by ants) ([Examples](https://imgur.com/a/gnb1m))\n- Change the color of the advancement icons (instead of the default gray, blue and orange)\n- Adds setting to stop fading of the advancements background on hover\n- Description boxes can grow slightly larger, so they are easier to read\n- Adds title of tab to title of advancements UI\n \n\nAlso available for Fabric for 1.18.2+","published":"2023-04-07T18:06:29.371671Z","updated":"2024-05-17T15:12:09.524963Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":895401,"followers":466,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["AmRxRO80","mF22Qbd5","6pucCggs","9KWatbqT","PbZp4J62","4KGj29N0","T2Rhiqp4","aarnAQQD","MpksJgtI","XbRG4Rhv","kZilh3jd","lAFAQGCz","Vp4GnzGH","KcsAOipK","WgdtSoqg","7a94H0Hr","B0ng8Gb6","pimFfXhN","OYPnvpWF","uHjK0raA","Zmn6s0Hf","MqXjcA0Z","gNEdbmCZ","FA2V323R","4b3NQ33t","vhpXnjE2","MoIoigS0","erWntBJJ","Sc1lIwGT","104TWtMl","YuGHLIEE","wD31Hv53","Pm0vQClW","PrIiocM8","3t6qjUkD","Ylg502ST","FzyevU7Q","vIzaje1Z","6u8OPPZC","HwWnm0Q5","kxsGQVxx","TDu5I4s4","QjBEtzgB","ozPAqAr0","p00hq2Ib","axkNZ11H","gJCmeWFh","KGkYBvtN","AYqUHwBU","IlpuIODg","pPfnAnVv","3SCa7I21","fZdN8pYl","Q0GTTzeM","qgtWXkJl"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Q2OqKxDG/b1519a191e62135647f66394d526d179ab5b598d.png"},"version":{"id":"MoIoigS0","project_id":"Q2OqKxDG","author_id":"cusaSPBz","featured":false,"name":"0.3.2.162 for Fabric 1.20.1","version_number":"0.3.2.162","changelog":"No changelog was specified.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-26T19:21:59.997752Z","downloads":214701,"version_type":"alpha","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"eba2da34d2b0f842336abd8610e4b5e111c1598d","sha512":"7116d166d519a9f99e47bfd38f53dffdad9028239bbf4141e8fcb7275c6028e7f2727299edc2544f9cdef02ce85cdec542122655639587fc1ec01a212fea9605"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Q2OqKxDG/versions/MoIoigS0/BetterAdvancements-Fabric-1.20.1-0.3.2.162.jar","filename":"BetterAdvancements-Fabric-1.20.1-0.3.2.162.jar","primary":true,"size":73331,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"eD6QfURA","user":{"id":"cusaSPBz","username":"way2muchnoise","name":"way2muchnoise","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5518998?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2023-04-07T17:52:42.130559Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"BetterAdvancements-Fabric-1.20.1-0.3.2.162.jar"},"mods\\formationsoverworld-1.0.3.jar":{"sha512":"47e25d084c23b76c7a3590a655f17ea8830e18770b1c6569faa07be63a51516440365ffba333a11f8c001bde36b3a4c31a0d19dcc83ea3838943d4f8b9cbf54a","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"KX1XC0Oo","slug":"formations-overworld","project_type":"mod","team":"X5GvvccF","title":"Formations Overworld","description":"Formations Overworld adds plenty of new structures to the overworld!","body":"![Formations Overworld Banner](https://imgur.com/qjonte2.png)\n\n<br>\n<center>\n\n### **Formations Overworld** adds a bunch of new structures to the various overworld biomes!\n</center>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/yl2Gq3d.png)\n\n## Structures\nSome examples of the structure you can find in Formations Overworld.

All previous features have been restored and some new ones added, with new development promised for the future on the opensource github profile!\n\n---\n\nExpect to see a more rich and immersive Minecraft world, one where Presence Footsteps adds new and more dynamic sounds for every block the player walks on. Every block has its own material assigned to it, and can make their own, customized sounds to better match what they're made of.\n\n---\n\n- Wooden chests are creaky and old,\n- stone is dusty and rough.\n- Piston heads sound like wood, whilst their bodies are stone,\n- even cake sounds like you might destroy if you step in the frosting!\n- Tall grass and bristles make a dry, rustling sound as you step through them,\n- Magma sounds like it's literally cooking your souls!\n\n---\n\nNot only that, but the latest version includes step sounds for certain non-block entities:\n\n---\n\nShulkers make the same creaky box noises as Shulker boxes, boats sound like wood, and armour stands creak and produce a stone stepping sound as you walk on their stone slab base.\n\n ---\n\n## Sound Packs\n\nPresence Footsteps is **fully customisable** with resource packs. The mod by default includes a pack with its own sounds\nand material mappings for the vanilla blocks, however if you don't like those sounds or want to use your own, this pack can be turned off\nor used together with packs from the community.\n\nNote that you need **at least one** sounds pack enabled for the mod to function.\n\n![image](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/assets/6429283/9c50aa59-0f59-4324-aab7-cb360acac2ad)\n\n## Mod Support\n\nPresence Footsteps will attempt to figure out the sounds of modded blocks by looking at the vanilla material/sound types they use.\nIf your mod is using very unique sounds though, you can add mappings to your mod to directly control what sounds presence footsteps uses for your block by\nfollowing the [guide on our wiki](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/wiki/Information-for-Resourcepack-Creators)\n","published":"2020-12-30T13:18:36.966588Z","updated":"2024-05-16T14:32:57.276315Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2468326,"followers":2567,"categories":["decoration"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.7.10","1.8.9","1.9.4","1.10","1.16.1","1.16.2-pre1","1.16.2-pre2","1.16.2-pre3","1.16.2-rc1","1.16.2-rc2","1.16.2","1.16.3-rc1","1.16.3","1.16.4-pre1","1.16.4-pre2","1.16.4-rc1","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17-rc1","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","23w12a","23w13a","23w13a_or_b","1.20-pre6","1.20-pre7","1.20-rc1","1.20","1.20.1-rc1","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","23w51a","23w51b","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","liteloader","quilt"],"versions":["BEtLdX9C","wl2DCPmO","iu4qJBKh","U0g0vHwf","r0Hz3hFo","3R7j6E4Z","20NGWQNM","2Dcs7kJq","cXdGDBED","HSI3wnPT","31QS6G6Z","gLDVmoRt","IUc6dyrf","9ZPyiU8N","3fEb2K4u","GExGOzbi","M7mmrOFn","M7xLhDyx","jxsFtML2","FMF3yzCR","KrTss88l","pOCYcZUF","giebTOyU","teGodXxG","Vt7ls0pO","3JQQCViD","douonZQK","WswrXhsm","LIWEWgbC","KAmTaDGR","EvZkNyaK","ji7wRvVK","HwGHderf","LjDXTyEn","skZ5rNJe","HcfMgmXT","378nQU71"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/rcTfTZr3/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"LjDXTyEn","project_id":"rcTfTZr3","author_id":"8a7Nm6u3","featured":true,"name":"Presence

In the item wheel, pressing the middle mouse button while having an item selected switches to related items(if available).\n\n## Features\n\n- Switch between items from the inventory\n- Show the inventory from an empty hand\n- Switch between items from shulker boxes in the inventory(requires the mod/plugin on the server)\n- Item wheel for block pallets\n- Item list for dynamic items like tools, food, potions, etc.\n- Fully customizable via resource packs\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- FabricAPI\n\n## Credits\n\n- [Xisumavoid](https://www.youtube.com/xisumavoid) for the idea/video of the concept\n- [LizardOfOz](https://www.youtube.com/LizardOfOz) Designer\n- [Stridey](https://modrinth.com/user/Stridey) Textures\n- [DnatorGames](https://twitter.com/DnatorGames) Logo\n- [Ratty](https://github.com/RodentMastermind) for the help with the resource pack\n\n## Images\n\n![Plank Types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tr7zw/ItemSwapper/1.19/img/planktypes.png)\n![Wood Options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tr7zw/ItemSwapper/1.19/img/woodoptions.png)\n![Dyes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tr7zw/ItemSwapper/1.19/img/dyes.png)\n![Tools](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tr7zw/ItemSwapper/1.19/img/tools.png)\n![Potions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tr7zw/ItemSwapper/1.19/img/potions.png)\n![Redstone](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tr7zw/ItemSwapper/1.19/img/redstone.png)","published":"2022-10-13T20:10:52.227649Z","updated":"2024-05-03T18:30:14.223585Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":396387,"followers":1070,"categories":["game-mechanics","management","storage"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","23w43a","23w43b","23w44a","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["bukkit","fabric","paper","purpur","spigot"],"versions":["X24q2iia","O2KOHSPJ","Ri0QCixj","j5VqRZlF","QmIKzS7b","rf2jLZvC","ydbCLkJa","6cmQDpI7","YAMyEX1t","MZAKaMqE","WZU4j0Uk","OgfOEQMc","sFclEion","5SS5s8Mr","c02hnEPx","ezuMmkdM","NEBVxulw","E7jCNr0p","Z2YZdulh","zUblkil8","eBv5OCE8","IIT4cam4","UAt5HtUi","UKVc6pCj","Y9iT5w8V","XxGZrbe7","jfp7lVou","A5Tlb5il","xMkAPaKv","OGEYAvEA","utlGYv3m","DnuAj8Ac","bOt4L3Cq","UAeQ386q","qv7wplge","lztTeX5G","iBm41V3V","waCJpGjB","O0HEXsMx","8NNSHqtS","fPe4S1TZ","Vd6TkStD","MltNFxS2","kyU5ZZC5"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/RPOSBQgq/2ab4614cc4288baa911be0365cd22203e75b9233.png"},"version":{"id":"fPe4S1TZ","project_id":"RPOSBQgq","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":true,"name":"v0.6.3-1.20.1 - Fabric","version_number":"0.6.3","changelog":"## Changes\r\n* Fixed not being able to join singleplayer twice in 1.20.6\r\n* Fixed item lists not rendering the selected item at some GUI scale + aspect ratios\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/tr7zw/ItemSwapper/compare/v0.6.2...v0.6.3","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-03T18:29:55.729872Z","downloads":5624,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"f1677e6e3268d26c3cd05dff22b213158dc3da0d47b5f2d8b8bf1b45ecee741128d36c610f6cb7e0d1cb6bbd167f4730bad5175d497502717c810ac54e633563","sha1":"81a6e5a9c45663d9f08d5baee11ab06be1fc0b87"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/RPOSBQgq/versions/fPe4S1TZ/itemswapper-fabric-0.6.3-mc1.20.1.jar","filename":"itemswapper-fabric-0.6.3-mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":974660,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"b225Efzu","user":{"id":"31j7L936","username":"Stridey","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/31j7L936/02b2f8231578d72f1c9b404edb848928a6402073.png","bio":null,"created":"2022-05-01T15:49:45.517346Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Textures","ordering":0},{"team_id":"b225Efzu","user":{"id":"Qnt13hO8","username":"tr7zw","name":"tr7zw","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/Qnt13hO8/icon.png","bio":"https://tr7zw.dev/","created":"2022-05-04T13:41:52.033912Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"itemswapper-fabric-0.6.3-mc1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\graves-3.0.1+1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"84aa4b1bc9b1b9a5ae6f72ff7c8f1b9983d7285a7abf297cfbdf20b6f36a5e47444a57d0b9b8dbd966150ad427e3a8c486f61603f7eaff16ea75038fe3b62575","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"yn9u3ypm","slug":"universal-graves","project_type":"mod","team":"9DxYRsEU","title":"Universal Graves","description":"Customisable grave mod for Fabric!","body":"<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PMONXxW.png\" width=\"256px\"/>\n\n# Universal Graves\nIt's a simple, but really customisable grave/death chest mod!

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury

Sods use vanilla grass tint, which means it will match the color from the biome it's in!\n\n\n✏️ Texture pack compatibility. All sods use vanilla textures, which means resource packs are compatible by default.\n\n\n☀️ Shader PBR compatibility. Are you using a resourcepack with PBR? Sods will have it too!\n\n\n⚙️ Vanilla & Modded map compatibility (Correct coloring on maps and minimaps like Xaero's or FTB)\n\n\n🧟 Control mob spawning.

This is shown in an extended section of the horse inventory GUI.\n* These stats can be trained by simply riding the horse with a saddle, and will increase over time.\n* Horses no longer require a saddle to be controlled. This will however not count towards training.\n* Saddles will prevent a horse from bucking.\n* You can now feed horses while riding them by interacting with it with a food item (excluding hay bales) while looking down.\n* All horses have 15 hearts instead of a variable amount.\n* Leather horse armor allows horses to safely ride over powder snow.\n* Skeleton Horses are no longer slowed by Soul Sand.\n* Llamas can be trained to have more inventory slots by leading them around.\n```\n\n## External Links\nSupport me on Ko-fi!

hostile bee shown below the mod name.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40846040/211122783-e4bde0e7-f721-48aa-8095-54dd8319ed40.png)\n\n# **1.19.2 OR NEWER MC RECOMMENDED**\n\n###### [[Click here for the NeoForge/Forge version of this mod!]](https://modrinth.com/mod/the-bumblezone)\n\n\n## **WHAT IS THE BUMBLEZONE?**\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bumblezone is a bee dimension filled with many brand new bee-related blocks! There's even quite a few structures to explore and a unique bee armor you can obtain! If you are lucky, you may find a special Throne-Locating Honey Compasses from certain structures that leads you to a Bee Queen! The dimension itself looks like it is the inside of a bee nest and you will find giant walls in rows with canals of water between them. Maybe you'll even find a pollen covered section of the dimension or a canyon full of massive honey-based crystals! Check the Bumblezone advancements tab for how to enter dimension and what to do!\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, you will find bees are extremely protective of their honey in this dimension. If you mine vanilla's Honey Block, destroy or take honey from Honeycomb Brood Block, or you hit a bee, all bees around you will get many buffs and will become VERY angry at you because you now have the Wrath of the Hive effect! But by feeding bees or the Honeycomb Brood Blocks with the honey foods that you have, you might be able to calm them down. By feeding bees or that brood block, you get Protection of the Hive that makes bees defend you against anyone attacking you! *(You can nerf the bees in the config if you find them too strong or buff them if you want to die!)*\n\n**Note:** If you have severe trypophobia and the current Bumblezone textures are too much, you can enable the internal mod Anti-Trypophobia resourcepack by going into the resourcepack screen and move the resourcepack to the top of the right side to activate it.\n\n**And yes, you can use this mod in a modpack!**\n\n<hr>\n\n## **WHAT DOES THIS MOD HAVE?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCheck out the wiki below for all the info! It is kept up to date on latest Bumblezone releases.\n\n**[https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/Bumblezone/wiki](https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/Bumblezone/wiki)**\n\n![All the Blocks, Items, and Mobs in Bumblezone](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/eA8SXqWL/images/bc1b120f1e7592fcbcbd64f9aa407075436976ec.png)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr>\n\n**If you find an issue, glitch, or have a suggestion about my mod, let me know!

client-sided mod that offers various toggle-able QOL changes and tweaks (GUI, Game/World Interaction)","body":"***Both Fabric and Forge versions require [Cloth config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config), For fabric you should install [Modmenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) to access the config screen***   \n\nSomeOrdinaryTweaks is a mod that adds few GUI/HUD/Rendering Tweaks and gives ability to turn off selective toast groups (tutorial/advancement/recipe unlock popups), also includes few misc features. every feature will be listed down below   \n***Every feature can be turned on or off***\n\n# Features/Tweaks   \n   \n- `Hide Shield`\n  - With this option enabled, It stops rendering the shield if the player is holding the shield item in the off hand and not holding a weapon in the main hand.   \n- `Hide Totem of Undying`\n  - With this option enabled, It stops rendering the Totem of undying if the player is holding it in the off hand.   \n- `Better Horse HUD`\n  - With this option enabled, the the health of any entity the player is riding on will display alongside the player hunger bar, Instead of replacing it. The player XP bar will render instead of the jump meter unless the player attempts to jump.   \n- `Disable Scoreboard Rendering` *(1.19.x-1.6.0+ versions only)*\n   -  With this option enabled, it stops rendering the side scoreboard.   \n- `Toast Controls.`\n   - Allows to Individually disable Advancement/Tutorial/Recipe Unlock Toasts/Popups (Error/Issue/System Toasts will still display as they contain important things that the user should not ignore).   \n- `Skip Server Resourcepack Downloads `\n  - This option allows you to accept a server resource pack without downloading it/enabling it. Specially useful if you have a slow internet or a old PC and want to play on a server that mandates a really high resolution resource pack.   \n- `Disable Portals closing GUIs`\n   - This option gives you the ability to open the Inventories(like chests or your inventory) and the chat while inside of a nether portal. *hopefully* no more getting trapped on a nether portal in some random sever with a claiming plugin.   \n- `Death coords in the Death Screen`\n  - Shows the coordinates of where you died in the death screen, also gives a button to copy the cords to the clipboard. This is a another standalone mod of mine that has been merged to this mod. I will continue to update the standalone mod that features this feature (Where-is-my-Stuff).   \n- `Send Death Coords In Chat`\n   - If enabled, the death cords will be sent to the chat (only visible to the you) after you respawn.   \n- `Smart Edible Crop Placement`\n   - With this option enabled, It prevents placing edible crop-blocks like sweet berries/carrots/potatoes. the player is still able to place down the crop by holding shift.     \n- `FullBright` *(1.19+ versions only)*\n  - This options turns gamma to a higher value allowing for clearer perception of dark areas. (Do note some servers might consider this as an unfair advantage)   \n- `Off Hand Item Slot Location` *(1.19.x-1.5.0+ versions only)*\n   - LEFT -> The off hand item slot will always be rendered on the left side of the hotbar\n   -  Right -> The off hand item slot will always be rendered on the right side of the hotbar\n    - VANILA -> Default Vanila Configuration   \n- `No double slab placement`\n   - With this option enabled, It prevents the player from placing a slab-block in a place where it could form into a double slab block   \n   \n***Some newer features are not yet back-ported to older versions (>1.19), That will be done in some time in the future. No ETA***\n\n## Forge/NeoForge compatibility\nYou can use this mod with Forge/NeoForge thanks to [Sinytra Connector](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector) compatibility layer. Simply put Sinytra Connector mod and SomeOrdinaryTweaks mod and cloth config mod in the mods folder. **Do not put modmenu mod, you can access SOT config with forge mods screen**\n\n**Better Horse HUD feature does not work in forge as of now**\n   \n\n## How to configure the options   \nTo access the config you must have modmenu mod installed, Simply click the `Mods` button that modmenu provides, Scroll down and find SomeOrdinaryTweaks mod, click it and then click the configure icon, You will be presented with the config screen.   \n\n![Modmenu Config Icon](https://i.imgur.com/oR1x6o8.png)\n","published":"2021-11-26T12:06:46.390671Z","updated":"2023-09-25T14:02:34.535901Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":15216,"followers":67,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3-rc1","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["fHlHqOEN","CeUSPb9J","Rrc4bb3y","SaOn06Vv","R1OUUIUl","PK9pUrx0","QoSOCDZS","nyTDv34N","ijsDaK5l","8kA96aNS","YBxjgYCA","njuyJH9j","ecPLyXca","3e8bRREh","DdIyvPXF","MgpD1Klf","eWtjdA7Z","TpmNuRlo","LL3C3Z5e","zKfXGkaO","f5aZ5OAl","6aErRT8p","p4W5KzFD","tLRyYvbW","9LFhWArv","qDS5teJT","t63ZAtGQ","glS8CV4b","BrhmZQDc","i78tiLsu"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LNeXYJOg/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"BrhmZQDc","project_id":"LNeXYJOg","author_id":"qxFOUntv","featured":true,"name":"SomeOrdinaryTweaks-1.20-1.7.0-alpha","version_number":"fabric-1.20-1.7.0-alpha","changelog":"- ALPHA FEATURE - Variable background opacity per different components, the feature is unfinished\n- **Quilt support will not be guaranteed from now on**, why? read [here](https://sleeping.town/@unascribed/110697228392834842) and [here](https://quiltmc.org/en/blog/2023-06-26-mau-beacon/\n  )","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-12T14:25:58.889447Z","downloads":4600,"version_type":"alpha","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"ad8d9d3c180b6a3844b84303e5d7413bba500fdb","sha512":"5167479e01b6b294adcd2a4bb90348b187b8b3bbcc9e27ad0409d41d44d64191b7b93d2236eeb25ac00af8dcfc831c4ed9cd066abd83a1e192affc95eb318568"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LNeXYJOg/versions/BrhmZQDc/some-ordinary-tweaks-1.7.0%2B1.20-alpha.jar","filename":"some-ordinary-tweaks-1.7.0+1.20-alpha.jar","primary":true,"size":248854,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"eTCL1uh8","project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":"s7VTKfLA","project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"zlfQpCtz","user":{"id":"qxFOUntv","username":"AdelinaM17n","name":"Maheesha","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/qxFOUntv/49e2246970eddb46939d753419e1c8a8634ec2b5.png","bio":"I mostly focus on making mods that are fully client sided which aims to make the playing experience on vanilla servers better.","created":"2021-02-06T13:04:43.116934Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"some-ordinary-tweaks-1.7.0+1.20-alpha.jar"},"mods\\voidz-1.0.11.jar":{"sha512":"6d4aaa06bdc3beeacefd81c66e5e70e1bd5b4758895db7bbb4671e9d97c6c3a5f9d7359550b1fa70d29745358ebe40a369c7c26be50f371f86f9ab20560781bd","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"OMiCHIwt","slug":"voidz","project_type":"mod","team":"9OcwESIp","title":"VoidZ","description":"Boss addon for the AdventureZ mod","body":"![Headline](https://i.imgur.com/aw8IZDr.png)\n\n<center>\n\n[<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/discord/745451299713056791?color=7289DA&label=DISCORD&logo=discord&logoColor=white&style=for-the-badge\">](https://discord.gg/cV4cJyGXqF) \n[<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/website?color=7bc466&label=Globox&style=for-the-badge&up_message=Wiki&url=https://globox1997.github.io/wiki/mods/VoidZ/\">](https://globox1997.github.io/wiki/mods/VoidZ/)\n[<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/github/issues/Globox1997/VoidZ?color=c4667b&style=for-the-badge\">](https://github.com/Globox1997/VoidZ/issues)\n</center>\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/K0Bn3Mh.png\" alt= “Description” width=\"25%\" height=\"auto\">\n<br><br/>\n\nVoidZ is an addon for the [AdventureZ](https://modrinth.com/mod/adventurez) mod.

With Create, the game isn't played inside a bunch of UIs, it challenges you to setup contraptions of animated components working together in many possible arrangements.</p>\n<p>Create's visual in-game documentation called 'Ponder' will guide you though all added mechanics and gadgets.</p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: In order to be able to see all recipes required in Create, consider installing a Recipe Viewer mod. Create has full support for <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei\">JEI</a>, <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/rei\">REI</a>, and <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/emi\">EMI</a>. The vanilla recipe book will not be able to guide you through the experience by itself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a

mod that focuses on things other than rendering","body":"## BadOptimizations\nA collection of mostly micro optimizations that add up to something bigger!\n\n## Wait, what does this even do?\nIt does multiple things:<p>\n\n- **Avoid updating lightmap**<p>\n  Updating lightmap textures are probably the most expensive part of the client tick. During each tick, the client will do some vector math to calculate lightmaps for blocks and the sky, then upload that new texture to the GPU. However, this can be completely avoided and cached if nothing affecting brightness is changed. This mod will cancel lightmap updates if nothing that changes brightness (e.g. gamma slider, potion effects) has changed. \n- **Sky color calculation optimizations**<p>\n  Minecraft uses `CubicScampler.sampleColor` every frame to calculate the current sky color. This function loops 216 times to factor in surrounding biomes-even if all surrounding biomes are identical or have identical sky colors. This mod makes this function only get called if you are between biomes with different sky colors and only makes it get called every tick. Otherwise, a shorter, simpler and faster sky color calculation is used.\n- **Don't do debug logic if we don't need to**<p>\n  Minecraft has four debug renderers that can be activated with a debug server: bees, game events, game test and villager AI. Even if there's nothing to process, the logic for these debug renderers are still executed. This mod will only execute them if debug is enabled and there is data to process.\n\n<p>\nThat's all the major ones, at least.\nYou can disable any optimization in the config file if you need to.\n</p>\n\n## But how much does it help?\n*(tested on my own PC with an RTX 3060, intel i7 12700 and 4GB of allocated ram on Fabulously Optimized)*<p>\nWithout toasts, it goes from 1926-1955 FPS:<p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/assets/104597976/523f9117-5dfb-469a-a1e3-2e5c32597057\" width=\"256\"><p>\nTo 2008-2023 FPS:<p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/assets/104597976/a27fcfab-c9ac-4fb0-9dfa-fc2efc61b2f4\" width=\"256\"><p>\nAnd with toasts, it goes from 1351-1384 FPS:<p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/assets/104597976/859f710b-036e-4080-9e94-ceaaf5a9bbf9\" width=\"256\"><p>\nTo 1414-1458 FPS:<p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/assets/104597976/5a01d4a7-0789-465d-a08f-aaa54386deb7\" width=\"256\"><p>\n\n## Dependencies?\nNone.\n\n*(Also available on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/badoptimizations)!)*","published":"2023-12-03T23:38:30.615171Z","updated":"2024-04-27T02:45:11.246442Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":734275,"followers":359,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["4iRxgKYG","7EtZn21b","LvWnmLrW","CMQm449N","QPNT0tat","ww747oVi","R5epQB48","7mkIryQX","N83O7mRY","tPcndzIs","Rya4Prxg","P1VV7yAB","osrW6S8S","5iiizW8v","NPtJUzCQ","xrCxVWjv","csMggyw8","pYctvKKH","ByJJBuGh","frxUrBuZ","f80P5Er3","ajq5p3Cr","lVUqygYP","6qzarF6r","py5wZc1k","9vTW5SzW","ouYuE0eo","RppoOA91","o0gYJCDi","x9zMt7t7","Tyi2q14M","QFKaP0NG","PY8WFC19","YPx40hkR","WZB4pQ3u","l5RWBdez","yK1K2DcH","pNkHByNm","tfPcVhXP","NepFM2XR","74fRkfKB","PXrqBQZG","O6GYJnvX","vJEBno3y","84AEMPgv","DkQi3drk","KWwNfrjN","wlqlZ5hE","37M8Rd4S","KeVurIPw","8JJc3kIM","r88RTaW8","Go4FoZir","dAVlOLS6","cpFHy43X","bOuSwVyc","aKkny43Y","918aozAU","zLWPzGCh","Gsub2Uuo","ydYsXrGL","eT6Jsaq5","zZYSuJ5b","bpmrr094"],"icon_url":null},"version":{"id":"eT6Jsaq5","project_id":"g96Z4WVZ","author_id":"MtdsrsRk","featured":true,"name":"2.1.1 (1.20.1)","version_number":"2.1.1","changelog":"**This is the final supported release for 1.19.3/1.19.4!

Pushing\nthis button will show a list of all possible results with the currently selected result highlighted\nin green. Selecting one of the listed results will change the smelting output to match. This\nselection will be saved to the block itself and persist across world loading and unloading.\n\n### Smithing\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/GTCgL3S/smithingconflicts.png)\n\nExactly like the crafting screen, a button will appear above the output slot when a valid input matches more than one\noutput. Upon selection, the output will change to match.\n\n### Commands\n\nTo assist identifying potential conflicts, there's a command `/polymorph conflicts` that will try to identify recipes\nthat conflict with each other and outputs a list of them to your logs folder. Currently, the command will scan crafting,\nsmelting, blasting, smoking, and smithing recipes.\n\n## Affiliates\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.ibb.co/1G4QPdc/bh-illusive.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/illusive)\n","published":"2023-02-03T20:08:37.444573Z","updated":"2024-06-03T00:45:59.863661Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":956508,"followers":408,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["diy4s2XO","66Bkdq05","68l9BR3j","bT9w3gh5","hR8YtS8a","gxwQtnsA","vAv92Cl4","vuRsKlbz","cnPRpn78","tLFw14o5","haoNzeyv","750iJ3hO","rect6WEh","aYxyXMzJ","ChHxCoAb","STYYlkp8","wN8G3kAN","skUakdXR","uAleZkbS","SNlci35k","GKZ6KVfs","6Nyu412V","VQtXcHcR","bIDSNOm5","UlRasi89","l15iQHMn","AWwJD7yS","7L5hC81R","zncS6GGa","pJZr4yc3","8zhVFKEL","Sj0OPjRM","2BAp032A","FBfg7una","E4b6m0sQ","GcFD377O","km82tZAr","gXWxJGsW","Y8yR5ZhZ","qA4syOxx","akZJjqpV","iaqnjwBU","6tFcWl5d","Mq4la1Hv","W3ii0PIQ","N1NUMRCn","89IAarqG","ByjYK8ay","EYWxtHOI","V6TZ8mE6","OQP0nLJU","R9HsHDwY","GTEspIbt","wZ1N91Ci","yPIvYQkJ","QoURX3fY","3RJxqsNz","p4JIL4TF","3XAwKo9y","HpXWxhc2","WNLgny3d","9XFy7cdd"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tagwiZkJ/ed244c5829bde539763c7fffb55cb3194a349d66.png"},"version":{"id":"akZJjqpV","project_id":"tagwiZkJ","author_id":"zbpHS3ry","featured":false,"name":"polymorph-fabric-0.49.3+1.20.1","version_number":"0.49.3+1.20.1","changelog":"The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).\n\nThis is a copy of the changelog for the most recent version.

Even after the enchanting screen is closed! To put this new capability to good use, enchanting tables will <strong>Render Their Contents</strong> in the world. There are two different rendering modes to choose from.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Rerolling Enchantments</strong> has become extremely easy. The enchanting screen now has a dedicated button to do just that at a small cost of some lapis lazuli and a few experience points (not full enchantment levels to not ruin your level progress for enchanting as much). Costs are fully configurable and can even be set to completely free.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Enchanting tooltips will show not just a single random enchantment, instead they show the <strong>Complete Outcome</strong> of the enchanting process. This feature is disabled by default.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Additionally, to enable some basic automation, <strong>Hoppers</strong> can be used to input and output items in the following ways.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Top:</strong> Input for enchantable items</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Sides:</strong> Input for lapis lazuli</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Bottom:</strong> Output for enchanted items</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">And <strong>Comparators</strong> work, too! They will output a signal strength of 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on the amount of lapis lazuli items placed in the table. More than 3 items don't make a difference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Bookshelves no longer require <strong>Air Blocks</strong> between themselves and the enchanting table to count towards the current enchanting power. Instead, any block without a collision box, such as water, torches, or grass can be placed in between. Also the <strong>Number Of Bookshelves</strong> required for maximum level enchantments can be configured.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OwxZhGM.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/490/367/2022-08-27_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/490/368/2022-08-27_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Reroll enchantments with the click of a button</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>All, one or no enchantments can be shown on the tooltip</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/490/369/2022-08-27_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/490/370/2022-08-27_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Floating rendering for enchanting table contents</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Flat rendering for enchanting table contents</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/348/779/2021-03-16_09.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/348/780/2021-03-16_09.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Enchanting with bookshelves works underwater</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>A semi-automated setup for bulk enchanting using hoppers</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OwxZhGM.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Forge?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Install my <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod and do it directly in-game!</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Fabric?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Editing configs directly in-game has not yet been implemented. Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Fabric on versions of Minecraft before 1.19?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Older downloads are found on the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/easy-magic-fabric\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>old project page</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I just installed Easy Magic and it's not working!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> No new capabilities will be added to existing enchanting tables. You will need to manually break and replace the block. Same goes for converting enchanting tables back to vanilla after removing the mod.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: The new button for rerolling enchantments added to the enchanting screen is incompatible with my resource pack!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> The client config has an option to keep the book from the vanilla screen, the rerolling button will simply not be visible then. Rerolling still works as before, just by clicking the book now.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I want anvils to keep and render their contents as well!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sure thing, check out my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/easy-anvils\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Easy Anvils</span></a> mod which does just that and more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I'm using Apotheosis' or Quark's enchanting system, will Easy Magic work as well?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sadly no, Easy Magic only supports the vanilla system and will be overridden by other mods introducing their own.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OwxZhGM.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\"

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ⚙️ Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## 🐛 Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## 🎁 How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ❓ What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes. Please try Sodium (on Fabric) or Embeddium (on Forge) instead!\nUsing OptiFine with ModernFix is not officially supported, and may cause issues.\n\n## 🖥️ Need a server?

Description\nConnect your fences/walls with a decorative chain!\n\nUse the normal vanilla chain item on fences or walls, and you can create a chain for up to 7 blocks long (Configurable to 32 with config, however I do not support this and rendering issues may occur).\n\nThese chains have collision and can be broken when attacking it with a shear. \\\nSneak on fences if you want to place them normally.\n\n#### Images\n<h6>Path</h6>\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/legoatoom/ConnectibleChains/9c61b5c2fbe298f6dc01db78fd62d47bf363a673/src/main/resources/assets/images/2022-01-14_22.03.12.png\" height=\"250px\">\n\n\n#### Issues\nIf you have encountered any bugs or have some feedback, go to the GitHub [issues](https://github.com/legoatoom/ConnectibleChains/issues) page.\n\n#### Version Support\nI will not be supporting versions lower than 1.20.4\n\n#### Compatibility with other mods\nUsing `data/c/tags/items/chains.json` we check if an item can be used to make a catenary.\\\nThe code then assumes an `item` and `block`texture for the `knot` and `catenary`. \\\nThis implies that you can make anything a compatible chain, as long as you have textures available.\nFor modded players, you need to add a data pack where you  add tags for the modded chain items you want added.\n\nSee the example below to add `blockus:golden_chain`.\n```json\n{\n  \"replace\": false,\n  \"values\": [\n    \"minecraft:chain\",\n    \"blockus:golden_chain\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Forge?\nThere is a forge port however I do not maintain it. \\\nhttps://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/connectible-chains-forge\n\n\n### Known Bugs\nRendering a link that is perfectly vertical does not work.\n\n#### Other information\n\nIf there are invisible collisions for some reason, hold a shear while\nhaving entity hitboxes on (F3+B) to see the collisions and then attack them to remove them.\n","published":"2020-12-06T15:38:32.422936Z","updated":"2024-06-06T14:02:53.563340Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":292047,"followers":361,"categories":["decoration"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.4","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["Rr8RztrZ","w5XkMhjx","DJM9Bq9Y","PMdclX6T","tdRVytPZ","5veQpRBB","fkUg69XE","lOtiWG89","5p4W8dWq","45biHkt5","Km3xrQ1U","vqN8KeiB","S1eIthIl","GUXv2En7","t9MYW9lw","DBJGNfNA","nuA6kIaF","qSAa0vuB","lhn1Dwup","CTqdpZTL"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ykSfIgTw/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"qSAa0vuB","project_id":"ykSfIgTw","author_id":"C9JhURQF","featured":true,"name":"Connectible

Their ears should now properly show from behind instead of appearing as invisible.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-02-19T18:28:46.418584Z","downloads":16407,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"1cc41273567fe0a9ca0f221b61cab9ad6403961c","sha512":"a0d31a3f5795d5d57861de99cc6ee759b9137dc4e34f9f149b4cf60f8ca99277f63eb4322c76a2b568fb730e3271700457c14be32c5399681415240b44e3491e"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/sRzS8pFG/versions/xwhK0c6Z/hamsters-fabric-1.0.3-1.20.1.jar","filename":"hamsters-fabric-1.0.3-1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":449265,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"8BmcQJ2H","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"C1fmU65G","user":{"id":"ucSqtLQt","username":"crispytwig","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48872606?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-03-12T16:23:28.433017Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"hamsters-fabric-1.0.3-1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\resourcefulconfig-fabric-1.20.1-2.1.2.jar":{"sha512":"53a6ca7dd4c83963d56b7dc5fbeb9b71090461049931a45b912fda5e09b8aa716d9504f2e97c023995062482df27946d81bbf771252baaca0d6f46333c3947bf","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"M1953qlQ","slug":"resourceful-config","project_type":"mod","team":"HZyf49is","title":"Resourceful Config","description":"Resourceful Config is a mod that allows for developers to make cross-platform configs","body":"<img src=\"https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/RESOURCECONFIG/BH_RC_HEADER.png\" />\n<img src=\"https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/RESOURCECONFIG/BH_RC_OVERVIEW.png\"/>\n<center><h5>We make cross-platform configuration easy peezy!</h5></center>\n<center><h5>On forge, we use the official forge config system to make hot reloading possible.</h5></center>\n<center><h5>and on Fabric we use JSONC because they don't have a system.</h5></center>\n<center><h5>As of 1.20 we no longer use Forge's official system as it breaks quite easily.</h5></center>\n<center><h5>We also have a cool lit UI for the youngsters to enjoy because they lazy and stuff.</h5><h5>We also have a web interface for servers or clients if they want to use, <a href=\"https://config.teamresourceful.com/about\">more info here</a></h5></center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8Ha7I55.png\" alt=\"This config is litty as it possibly gets!\"/>\n<a href=\"https://discord.gg/resourcefulbees\"><img src=\"https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/RESOURCECONFIG/BH_RC_DISCORD.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"https://bisecthosting.com/teamresourceful\"><img src=\"https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/RESOURCECONFIG/BH_RC_PROMO.png\"/></a>","published":"2022-11-28T01:11:50.632330Z","updated":"2024-04-28T18:33:46.864485Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":916020,"followers":222,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["1sMRhcfE","CJ1EQWAX","AmKXTTvt","HLTIErHD","CC4DR9Ew","AT8w6BOY","ey867PKW","yaKkGeBn","geCYkuUf","uyEnPWwc","EbmW7KYO","ImsXyeAn","bodqKeZo","Jz5eewAo","hGInwt7S","OHgqw2cM","bpexXO5r","EDFKAsEd","SSywkHD2","QUCEXsuZ","JrjaKFMB","eQYA6EPm","vQZXd8C8","Mk4JvsHk","qKRFSQCB","Z9VrRna2","Gv8qpOL7","CDqoVuzU","yEcynctB","zrSzjHIt","6k0hdREk","TIzyR4bY","n3yQ9KKD","JXU6RJAv","iktUkXe8","nVDWZ9N7","RWBTLDls","EFajw54I","HaBv9PTz","vQPGCfih","JBxXTqOr","9jltWR8L","vDvFwHAq","pZINfkWf","C3vAAE9x","2qMl5afY","5NnWZvd6","30wspqZe","tRs8WNph","nFlSpFWY","irREd1ZJ","PlEObkl9","AEjcN8G2","YKChBq8o","qpaBKKtA","JpRMedNr","UNSYgT5m","LTivPqAB","rEhLowE3","wkxW5K1t","Uqp2T1FX","mREDowcJ","y6VWSwg4","WuHokYiB","2eqslKBS","r8C9UHfr","5DDRLs1v","cKooWmav","p5YdFE5o","LrfrfR1J","o6HkmYGU"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/M1953qlQ/2e0da928f67bd804ee4ef8205b747439f713f5bd.png"},"version":{"id":"PlEObkl9","project_id":"M1953qlQ","author_id":"VTfgLJ1p","featured":true,"name":"[Fabric] Resourceful Config 2.1.2","version_number":"2.1.2","changelog":"Add sort order for category annotations.\nMake config screen a pause screen.
